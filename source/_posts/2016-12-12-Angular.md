# Angular JS notes

AngularJS applications are built around a design pattern called Model-View-Controller (MVC), which places an emphasis on creating applications that are

- Extendable: It is easy to figure out how even a complex AngularJS app works once you understand the basicsâ€”and that means you can easily enhance applications to create new and useful features for your users.
- Maintainable: AngularJS apps are easy to debug and fix, which means that long-term maintenance is simplified.
- Testable: AngularJS has good support for unit and end-to-end testing, meaning that you can find and fix defects before your users do.
- Standardized: AngularJS builds on the innate capabilities of the web browser without getting in your way, allowing you to create standards-compliant web apps that take advantage of the latest features (such as HTML5 APIs) and popular tools and frameworks.
