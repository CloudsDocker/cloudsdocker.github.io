# Enum Misc

- All enums implicitely extends **java.lang.Enum**
- Enum in Java are **type-safe**
- You can specify values of enum constants at the **creation** time. **Enum.values()** returns an array of MyEnumâ€™s values.
- Enum constants are implicitly static and final and can not be changed once created.
- Enum can be safely compare using:
   - Switch-Case Statement
   - == Operator
   - .equals() method
- You can not create instance of enums by using new operator in Java because constructor of Enum in Java can only be private and Enums constants can only be created inside Enums itself.
- Instance of Enum in Java **is created when** any Enum constants are **first called or referenced** in code.
- An enum can be declared outside or inside a class, but NOT in a method.
- An enum declared outside a class must NOT be marked static, final , abstract, protected , or private
- Enums can contain constructors, methods, variables, and constant class bodies.
- enum constructors can have arguments, and can be overloaded.
- enum constructors can NEVER be invoked directly in code. They are always called automatically when an enum is initialized.
- The semicolon at the end of an enum declaration is optional.

These are legal:
```java
    enum Foo { ONE, TWO, THREE}
    enum Foo { ONE, TWO, THREE};
```
