# Enum Misc

- All enums implicitely extends **java.lang.Enum**
- Enum in Java are **type-safe**
- You can specify values of enum constants at the **creation** time. **Enum.values()** returns an array of MyEnumâ€™s values.
- Enum constants are implicitly static and final and can not be changed once created.
- Enum can be safely compare using:
   - Switch-Case Statement
   - == Operator
   - .equals() method
- You can not create instance of enums by using new operator in Java because constructor of Enum in Java can only be private and Enums constants can only be created inside Enums itself.
- Instance of Enum in Java **is created when** any Enum constants are **first called or referenced** in code.
- An enum can be declared outside or inside a class, but NOT in a method.
- An enum declared outside a class must NOT be marked static, final , abstract, protected , or private
- Enums can contain constructors, methods, variables, and constant class bodies.
- enum constructors can have arguments, and can be overloaded.
- enum constructors can NEVER be invoked directly in code. They are always called automatically when an enum is initialized.
- The semicolon at the end of an enum declaration is optional.

These are legal:
```java
    enum Foo { ONE, TWO, THREE}
    enum Foo { ONE, TWO, THREE};
```

# type safe
The advantage of this style of enumeration over the C/C++-style enum or constants is that they are **type-safe**, meaning that, for example, if you define a method
```java
public void setSuit(Suit suit) { ... }
```
the caller cannot pass in a value that does not correspond to an enumeration value

# Language level features
- Since enumeration instances are all effectively **singletons**, they can be compared for equality using identity ("==").
- In Java 5.0, the enum keyword is introduced as a special type of class that always extends **java.lang.Enum**.
- Note that the enumeration values are still **static class members**, though not declared as such.

# Reverse lookup
Often in your object model it is common to have data that is naturally "associated" with an enumeration. Since an enum is a class, it is easy to represent this associated information as class fields. Often it is desirable to "lookup" the associated enumeration using the field value. This is easy to do using a static java.util.Map. Take, for example, a Status enum that has an associated status code.
```java
public enum Status
{
     WAITING(0),
     READY(1),
     SKIPPED(-1),
     COMPLETED(5);

     private static final Map<Integer,Status> lookup
          = new HashMap<Integer,Status>();

     static {
          for(Status s : EnumSet.allOf(Status.class))
               lookup.put(s.getCode(), s);
     }

     private int code;

     private Status(int code) {
          this.code = code;
     }

     public int getCode() { return code; }

     public static Status get(int code) {
          return lookup.get(code);
     }
}
```
# Sleek EnumMap
Why would I use an EnumMap rather than a HashMap?  The primary reasons boil down to some inherent advantages of Java's enum as stated in the Javadoc documentation for EnumMap: "Enum maps are represented internally as arrays. This representation is extremely compact and efficient." Later in the same Javadoc documentation, there is an "Implementation Note" that states: "All basic operations execute in constant time. They are likely (though not guaranteed) to be faster than their HashMap counterparts."

The Javadoc documentation states similar advantages for the EnumSet over the HashSet:

> Enum sets are represented internally as **bit vectors**. This representation is extremely **compact and efficient**. The space and time performance of this class should be good enough to allow its use as a high-quality, typesafe alternative to traditional int-based 'bit flags.'  ... Implementation note: All basic operations execute **in constant time**. They are likely (though not guaranteed) to be much faster than their HashSet counterparts. Even **bulk operations execute in constant time** if their argument is also an enum set.
