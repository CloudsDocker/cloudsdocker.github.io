# Endpoints

Camel supports the Message Endpoint pattern using the Endpoint interface. Endpoints are usually created by a Component and Endpoints are usually referred to in the DSL via their URIs.

From an Endpoint you can use the following methods

createProducer() will create a Producer for sending message exchanges to the endpoint
createConsumer() implements the Event Driven Consumer pattern for consuming message exchanges from the endpoint via a Processor when creating a Consumer
createPollingConsumer() implements the Polling Consumer pattern for consuming message exchanges from the endpoint via a PollingConsumer

# implementation
When using the DSL to create Routes you typically refer to Message Endpoints by their URIs rather than directly using the Endpoint interface. Its then a responsibility of the CamelContext to create and activate the necessary Endpoint instances using the available Component implementations.


# connector
Sub interface including Initiator.
abstract class SessionConnector implements Connector


# session
class Session.java

# FieldMaps
Which leverage TreeMap<Integer, Field<?>> fields;

## Field

```java
public class Field<T> implements Serializable 


   public Field(int field, T object) {
        this.tag = field;
        this.object = object;
    }
```
