title: XA Transactions in 2PC
---
# Description

- 2 phase commit protocol referred to as XA(eXtended Architecture)
- This protocol provides ACID-like properties for global transaction processing
- 2 phase commit protocol is an atomic commitment protocol for distributed systems.
- The first one is commit-request phase in which transaction manager coordinates all of the transaction resources to commit or abort. 
- In the commit-phase, transaction manager decides to finalize operation by committing or aborting according to the votes of the each transaction resource. 
- XA transactions need a global transaction id and local transaction id(xid) for each XA resource.
- Each XA Resource is enlisted to XA Manager by start(xid) method. 
- This method tells that XA Resource is being involved in the transaction(be ready for operations). 
-  the first phase of the 2PC protocol is realized by calling prepare(xid) method. This method requests OK or ABORT vote from XA Resource. 
- After receiving vote from each of XA Resource, XA Manager decides to execute a commit(xid) operation if all XA Resources send OK or decides to execute a rollback(xid) if an XA Resource sends ABORT.
- Finally, the end(xid) method is called for each of XA Resource telling that the transaction is completed.
