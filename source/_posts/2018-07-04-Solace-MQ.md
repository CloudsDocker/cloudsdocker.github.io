# Solace PubSub+ 
It is a message broker that lets you establish event-driven interactions between applications and microservices across hybrid cloud environments using open APIs and protocols.

# Deployment 

Cloud
PubSub+ Cloud is enterprise-grade messaging available as a fully managed service in your favorite public clouds.

## What do we mean by “enterprise grade?”
### Unrivaled Reliability
Intelligent routing protocols always identify best path and adapt around network issues to keep your applications humming, and automatic message buffering keeps bursts of data from affecting slow consumers or your system as a whole.

Built-in high availability and disaster recovery capabilities mean your system will bounce back in a flash, without ever losing a message, even in the event of major system or network failures.

### Serious Security
PubSub+ supports authentication and authorization mechanisms ranging from username and password and one-time passwords to sophisticated access control lists and robust integration with existing security policies and systems such as LDAP, Radius, Kerberos.

To protect messages in transit, Solace supports transport-layer TLS encryption using a variety of cypher suites.

## Messaging

In application development terms, messaging, which is also commonly known as message-oriented middleware or just middleware, refers to technology that lets computer systems share information without requiring direct connections or awareness of one another's location.
