# Binary Tree
- A binary tree is a tree in which no node can have more than two children.
- A property of a binary tree that is sometimes important is that the depth of an average
binary tree is considerably smaller than N. An analysis shows that the average depth is √O( N), and that for a special type of binary tree, namely the binary search tree, the average value of the depth is O(log N). Unfortunately, the depth can be as large as N − 1, 

# Cyclic List
## Round Robin scheduling
- using some form of an algorithm known as round-robin scheduling. A process is given a short turn to execute, known as a time slice, but it is interrupted when the slice ends, even if its job is not yet complete.

## Ring Buffer
In other words, the circular buffer is well-suited as a FIFO buffer while a standard, non-circular buffer is well suited as a LIFO buffer.
Circular buffering makes a good implementation strategy for a queue that has fixed maximum size. Ref to [this wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer)
