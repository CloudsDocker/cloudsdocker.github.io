## Ring Buffer
In other words, the circular buffer is well-suited as a FIFO buffer while a standard, non-circular buffer is well suited as a LIFO buffer.
Circular buffering makes a good implementation strategy for a queue that has fixed maximum size. Ref to [this wiki page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer)
