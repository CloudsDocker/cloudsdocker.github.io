<p>the motto “ZooKeeper: Because Coordinating Distributed Systems is a Zoo.”</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="Features-of-Zookeeper"><a href="#Features-of-Zookeeper" class="headerlink" title="Features of Zookeeper"></a>Features of Zookeeper</h1><ul>
<li>Synchronization − Mutual exclusion and co-operation between server processes.</li>
<li>Ordered Messages - The strict ordering means that sophisticated synchronization primitives can be implemented at the client.</li>
<li>Reliability - The reliability aspects keep it from being a single point of failure.</li>
<li>Atomicity − Data transfer either succeeds or fails completely, but no transaction is partial.</li>
<li>High performant - The performance aspects of Zookeeper means it can be used in large, distributed systems.</li>
<li>Distributed.</li>
<li>High avaliablity.</li>
<li>Fault-tolerant.</li>
<li>Loose coupling.</li>
<li>Partial failure.</li>
<li>High throughput and low latency - data is stored data in memory and on disk as well.</li>
<li>Replicated.</li>
<li>Automatic failover: When a Zookeeper dies, the session is automatically migrated over to another Zookeeper.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Different-type-of-data"><a href="#Different-type-of-data" class="headerlink" title="Different type of data"></a>Different type of data</h2><p>When designing an application with ZooKeeper, one ideally separates application data from control or coordination data. For example, the users of a web-mail service are interested in their mailbox content, but not on which server is handling the requests of a particular mailbox. The mailbox content is application data, whereas the mapping of the mailbox to a specific mail server is part of the coordination data (or metadata). A ZooKeeper ensemble manages the latter.</p>
<p>The multiple processes consequently need to implement mutual exclusion. We can actually think of the task of acquiring mastership as the one of acquiring a lock: the process that acquires the mastership lock exercises the role of master.</p>
<p>Coordination does not always take the form of synchronization primitives like leader election or locks. Configuration metadata is often used as a way for a process to convey what others should be doing. For example, in a master-worker system, workers need to know the tasks that have been assigned to them, and this information must be available even if the master crashes.</p>
<h2 id="How-world-work-without-ZooKeeper"><a href="#How-world-work-without-ZooKeeper" class="headerlink" title="How world work without ZooKeeper"></a>How world work without ZooKeeper</h2><p>It is certainly possible to build distributed systems without using ZooKeeper. ZooKeep‐ er, however, offers developers the possibility of focusing more on application logic rather than on arcane distributed systems concepts. Programming distributed systems without ZooKeeper is possible, but more difficult.</p>
<h2 id="What-does-ZooKeeper-does-not-do"><a href="#What-does-ZooKeeper-does-not-do" class="headerlink" title="What does ZooKeeper does not do"></a>What does ZooKeeper does not do</h2><p>The ensemble of ZooKeeper servers manages critical application data related to coor‐ dination. ZooKeeper is not for bulk storage. For bulk storage of application data, there are a number of options available, such as databases and distributed file systems. When designing an application with ZooKeeper, one ideally separates application data from control or coordination data.</p>
<p>ZooKeeper, however, does not implement the tasks for you. It does not elect a master or track live processes for the application out of the box. Instead, it provides the tools for implementing such tasks. The developer decides what coordination tasks to implement.</p>
<p>Processes in a distributed system have two broad options for communication: they can exchange messages directly through a network, or read and write to some shared storage. ZooKeeper uses the shared storage model to let applications implement coordination and synchronization primitives. But shared storage itself requires network communi‐ cation between the processes and the storage. It is important to stress the role of network communication because it is an important source of complications in the design of a distributed system.</p>
<p>This scenario leads to a problem commonly called split-brain: two or more parts of the system make progress independ‐ ently, leading to inconsistent behavior. As part of coming up with a way to cope with master failures, it is critical that we avoid split-brain scenarios.</p>
<h1 id="Tasks"><a href="#Tasks" class="headerlink" title="Tasks"></a>Tasks</h1><p>The following requirements for our master-worker architecture:<br>Master election<br>It is critical for progress to have a master available to assign tasks to workers.<br>Crash detection<br>The master must be able to detect when workers crash or disconnect.<br>Group membership management<br>The master must be able to figure out which workers are available to execute tasks.<br>Metadata management<br>The master and the workers must be able to store assignments and execution sta‐ tuses in a reliable manner.</p>
<h1 id="CAP"><a href="#CAP" class="headerlink" title="CAP"></a>CAP</h1><p>known as CAP, which stands for Consistency, Availability, and Partition-tolerance, says that when designing a distributed system we may want all three of those properties, but that no system can handle all three.2 Zoo‐ Keeper has been designed with mostly consistency and availability in mind, although it also provides read-only capability in the presence of network partitions.</p>
<h1 id="ZooKeeper-Basics"><a href="#ZooKeeper-Basics" class="headerlink" title="ZooKeeper Basics"></a>ZooKeeper Basics</h1><p>Several primitives used for coordination are commonly shared across many applica‐ tions. Consequently, one way of designing a service used for coordination is to come up with a list of primitives, expose calls to create instances of each primitive, and ma‐ nipulate these instances directly. For example, we could say that distributed locks con‐ stitute an important primitive and expose calls to create, acquire, and release locks.<br>Such a design, however, suffers from a couple of important shortcomings. First, we need to either come up with an exhaustive list of primitives used beforehand, or keep ex‐ tending the API to introduce new primitives. Second, it does not give flexibility to the application using the service to implement primitives in the way that is most suitable for it.<br>We consequently have taken a different path with ZooKeeper. ZooKeeper does not ex‐ pose primitives directly. Instead, it exposes a file system-like API comprised of a small set of calls that enables applications to implement their own primitives. We typically use recipes to denote these implementations of primitives. Recipes include ZooKeeper operations that manipulate small data nodes, called znodes, that are organized hier‐ archically as a tree, just like in a file system.</p>
<h2 id="znodes"><a href="#znodes" class="headerlink" title="znodes"></a>znodes</h2><p>a few other znodes that could be useful in a master- worker configuration:</p>
<ul>
<li>The /workers znode is the parent znode to all znodes representing a worker avail‐ able in the system. Figure 2-1 shows that one worker (foo.com:2181) is available. If a worker becomes unavailable, its znode should be removed from /workers.</li>
<li>The /tasks znode is the parent of all tasks created and waiting for workers to execute them. Clients of the master-worker application add new znodes as children of /tasks to represent new tasks and wait for znodes representing the status of the task.</li>
<li>The /assign znode is the parent of all znodes representing an assignment of a task to a worker. When a master assigns a task to a worker, it adds a child znode to /assign.<h2 id="API"><a href="#API" class="headerlink" title="API"></a>API</h2>API Overview<br>Znodes may or may not contain data. If a znode contains any data, the data is stored as a byte array. The exact format of the byte array is specific to each application, and ZooKeeper does not directly provide support to parse it. Serialization packages such as Protocol Buffers, Thrift, Avro, and MessagePack may be handy for dealing with the format of the data stored in znodes, but sometimes string encodings such as UTF-8 or ASCII suffice.</li>
</ul>

<p>ZooKeeper clients connect to a ZooKeeper service and establish a session through which they make API calls. </p>
<p>If a worker becomes unavailable, its session expires and its znode in /workers disappears automatically.</p>
<p>An ephemeral znode can be deleted in two situations:</p>
<ol>
<li>When the session of the client creator ends, either by expiration or because it ex‐ plicitly closed.</li>
<li>When a client, not necessarily the creator, deletes it.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="Sequential-znodes"><a href="#Sequential-znodes" class="headerlink" title="Sequential znodes"></a>Sequential znodes</h3><p>A znode can also be set to be sequential. A sequential znode is assigned a unique, mo‐ notonically increasing integer. This sequence number is appended to the path used to create the znode. For example, if a client creates a sequential znode with the path /tasks/ task-, ZooKeeper assigns a sequence number, say 1, and appends it to the path. The path of the znode becomes /tasks/task-1. Sequential znodes provide an easy way to create znodes with unique names. They also provide a way to easily see the creation order of znodes.</p>
<h3 id="watch"><a href="#watch" class="headerlink" title="watch"></a>watch</h3><p>This is a common problem with polling. To replace the client polling, we have opted for a mechanism based on notifications: clients register with ZooKeeper to receive notifi‐ cations of changes to znodes. Registering to receive a notification for a given znode consists of setting a watch. A watch is a one-shot operation, which means that it triggers one notification. To receive multiple notifications over time, the client must set a new watch upon receiving each notification. </p>
<h2 id="Versions"><a href="#Versions" class="headerlink" title="Versions"></a>Versions</h2><p>Each znode has a version number associated with it that is incremented every time its data changes. A couple of operations in the API can be executed conditionally: setDa ta and delete. Both calls take a version as an input parameter, and the operation suc‐ ceeds only if the version passed by the client matches the current version on the server. The use of versions is important when multiple ZooKeeper clients might be trying to perform operations over the same znode. For example, suppose that a client c1 writes a znode /config containing some configuration. If another client c2 concurrently updates the znode, the version c1 has is stale and the setData of c1 must not succeed. Using versions avoids such situations. In this case, the version that c1 uses when writing back doesn’t match and the operation fails. </p>
<h1 id="ZooKeeper-Architecture"><a href="#ZooKeeper-Architecture" class="headerlink" title="ZooKeeper Architecture"></a>ZooKeeper Architecture</h1><p>Now that we have discussed at a high level the operations that ZooKeeper exposes to applications, we need to understand more of how the service actually works. Applica‐ tions make calls to ZooKeeper through a client library. The client library is responsible for the interaction with ZooKeeper servers.</p>
<p>ZooKeeper servers run in two modes: standalone and quorum. Standalone mode is pretty much what the term says: there is a single server, and ZooKeeper state is not replicated. In quorum mode, a group of ZooKeeper servers, which we call a ZooKeeper ensemble, replicates the state, and together they serve client requests. From this point on, we use the term “ZooKeeper ensemble” to denote an installation of servers. This installation could contain a single server and operate in standalone mode or contain a group of servers and operate in quorum mode.</p>
<h2 id="ZooKeeper-Quorums"><a href="#ZooKeeper-Quorums" class="headerlink" title="ZooKeeper Quorums"></a>ZooKeeper Quorums</h2><p>In quorum mode, ZooKeeper replicates its data tree across all servers in the ensemble. But if a client had to wait for every server to store its data before continuing, the delays might be unacceptable. In public administration, a quorum is the minimum number of legislators required to be present for a vote. In ZooKeeper, it is the minimum number of servers that have to be running and available in order for ZooKeeper to work. This number is also the minimum number of servers that have to store a client’s data before telling the client it is safely stored. For instance, we might have five ZooKeeper servers in total, but a quorum of three. So long as any three servers have stored the data, the client can continue, and the other two servers will eventually catch up and store the data.</p>
<p>It is important to choose an adequate size for the quorum. Quorums must guarantee that, regardless of delays and crashes in the system, any update request the service pos‐ itively acknowledges will persist until another request supersedes it.</p>
<p><code>The bottom line is that we should always shoot for an odd number of servers.</code></p>
<h2 id="sessions"><a href="#sessions" class="headerlink" title="sessions"></a>sessions</h2><p>All operations a client submits to ZooKeeper are associated to a session. When a session ends for any reason, the ephemeral nodes created during that session disappear.</p>
<p>the session may be moved to a different server if the client has not heard from its current server for some time. Moving a session to a different server is handled transparently by the ZooKeeper client library.</p>
<p>Sessions offer order guarantees, which means that requests in a session are executed in FIFO (first in, first out) order. Typically, a client has only a single session open, so its requests are all executed in FIFO order. If a client has multiple concurrent sessions, FIFO ordering is not necessarily preserved across the sessions.</p>

<h2 id="handle"><a href="#handle" class="headerlink" title="handle"></a>handle</h2><p>The ZooKeeper API is built around a ZooKeeper handle that is passed to every API call. This handle represents a session with ZooKeeper. A session that is established with one ZooKeeper server will migrate to another ZooKeeper server if its connection is broken. As long as the session is alive, the handle will remain valid, and the ZooKeeper client library will continually try to keep an active connection to a ZooKeeper server to keep the session alive. If the handle is closed, the ZooKeeper client library will tell the ZooKeeper servers to kill the session. If ZooKeeper decides that a client has died, it will invalidate the session. If a client later tries to reconnect to a Zoo‐ Keeper server using the handle that corresponds to the invalidated session, the Zoo‐ Keeper server informs the client library that the session is no longer valid and the handle returns errors for all operations.</p>
<p>The constructor that creates a ZooKeeper handle usually looks like:<br>ZooKeeper(<br>String connectString, int sessionTimeout, Watcher watcher)</p>
<h3 id="Implementing-a-Watcher"><a href="#Implementing-a-Watcher" class="headerlink" title="Implementing a Watcher"></a>Implementing a Watcher</h3><p>To receive notifications from ZooKeeper, we need to implement watchers.

<p>nce we have connected to ZooKeeper, there will be a background thread that will maintain the ZooKeeper session. This thread is a daemon thread, which means that the program may exit even if the thread is still active. Here we sleep for a bit so that we can see some events come in before the program exits.<br>We can compile this simple example using the following:<br>$ javac -cp $CLASSPATH Master.java<br>Once we have compiled Master.java, we run it and see the following:<br>$ java -cp $CLASSPATH Master 127.0.0.1:2181</p>
<h2 id="disconnect"><a href="#disconnect" class="headerlink" title="disconnect"></a>disconnect</h2><p>When developers see the Disconnected event, some think they need to create a new ZooKeeper handle to reconnect to the service. Do not do that! See what happens when you start the server, start the Master, and then stop and start the server while the Master is still running. You should see the SyncConnected event followed by the Disconnec ted event and then another SyncConnected event. The ZooKeeper client library takes care of reconnecting to the service for you. Unfortunately, network outages and server failures happen. Usually, ZooKeeper can deal with these failures.</p>

<ul>
<li>Mutual exclusion is about managing contented updtes to some resources.</li>
<li>Visibiliyt of change is about controlling when such changes are made visible to other threads.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mutal-exclusion"><a href="#mutal-exclusion" class="headerlink" title="mutal exclusion"></a>mutal exclusion</h2><p>It is possible to avoid the need for mutal exclusion if you can eliminate the need for contented updates. If your algorithm can guarantee that any given resource is modified by only one thread then utal exclusion is unnecessary.</p>
<p>Read and write operations require that all changes are made visible to other threads.</p>
<p>The most costly operation in any concurrent environment is a contended write access.</p>
<h3 id="locks"><a href="#locks" class="headerlink" title="locks"></a>locks</h3><p>Lock provide mutual exclusion and ensure that the visibility of change occurs in an ordered manner. Locks are incredibly expensive because they require arbitration when contended. This arbitration is achieved by a context switch to the OS kernerl which will suspend threads waiting on a lock until it’s released. During such a context switch , as well as releasing control to the OS which may decided to do other house-keeping tasks which it has control, execution context can lose previously cached data nad instrucionts. This can have a serious performance impact on modern CPU. </p>

<h1 id="Source-of-Truth"><a href="#Source-of-Truth" class="headerlink" title="Source of Truth"></a>Source of Truth</h1><p>For many teams, the Cucumber feature files become the definitive source of truth as to what the system does.</p>
<h1 id="Scenarios"><a href="#Scenarios" class="headerlink" title="Scenarios"></a>Scenarios</h1><p>Scenarios are written before production code. They start their life as an executable specification. As the production code emerges, Scenarios take on a role as living documentation and automated tests.</p>
<p>Each Cucumber test is called a scenario, and each scenario contains steps that tell Cucumber what to do. </p>
<h1 id="Gherkin"><a href="#Gherkin" class="headerlink" title="Gherkin"></a>Gherkin</h1><p>The keywords Feature, Scenario, Given, When, and Then are the structure, and everything else is documentation.<br>The structure is called Gherkin.</p>
<p>Cucumber features are all about communicating with business users in their language, and it’s important that we don’t force them to sound like robots.</p>
<h1 id="Structure"><a href="#Structure" class="headerlink" title="Structure"></a>Structure</h1><p>We start with features, which contain our scenarios and steps. The steps of our scenarios call step definitions that provide the link between the Gherkin fea- tures and the application being built.</p>
<p>This principle, deliberately doing the minimum useful work the tests will let us get away with, might seem lazy, but in fact it’s a discipline. It ensures that we make our tests thorough: if the test doesn’t drive us to write the right thing, then we need a better test.</p>
<h1 id="Step-Definitions"><a href="#Step-Definitions" class="headerlink" title="Step Definitions"></a>Step Definitions</h1><p>Step definitions are the glue that binds your Cucumber tests to the application you’re testing. </p>
<p>A scenario that’s been executed can end up in any of the following states:</p>
<ul>
<li>Failed</li>
<li>Pending</li>
<li>Undefined </li>
<li>Skipped</li>
<li>Passed<br>These states are designed to help indicate the progress that you make as you develop your tests.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Pending-Steps"><a href="#Pending-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Pending Steps"></a>Pending Steps</h3><p>When Cucumber discovers a step definition that’s halfway through being implemented, it marks the step as pending (yellow). Again, the scenario will be stopped, and the rest of the steps will be skipped or marked as undefined.</p>

<h2 id="Step-definition-recap"><a href="#Step-definition-recap" class="headerlink" title="Step definition recap"></a>Step definition recap</h2><p>The pending status is a bit like those under construction signs you used to see all over the Internet in the 1990s. You can use it as a temporary signpost to your teammates that you’re in the middle of working on something.</p>
<p>Because regular expressions can contain wildcards, this means you have the flexibility to make the Gherkin steps nice and readable, while keeping your Java step definition code clean and free of duplication.<br>• Step definitions provide a mapping from the Gherkin scenarios’ plain- language descriptions of user actions into Java code, which simulates those actions.<br>• Step definitions are registered with Cucumber by using @Given, @When, @Then, or one of the aliases for your spoken language.<br>• Step definitions use regular expressions to declare the steps that they can handle. Because regular expressions can contain wildcards, one step definition can handle several different steps.<br>• A step definition communicates its result to Cucumber by raising, or not raising, an exception.</p>
<h1 id="recap"><a href="#recap" class="headerlink" title="recap"></a>recap</h1><ul>
<li>Readability should be your number-one goal when writing Gherkin fea- tures. Always try to sit together with a stakeholder when you write your scenarios, or at the very least pass them over for feedback once you’ve written them. Keep fine-tuning the language in your scenarios to make them more readable.</li>
<li>Use a Background to factor out repeated steps from a feature and to help tell a story.</li>
<li>Repetitive scenarios can be collapsed into a Scenario Outline.</li>
<li>Steps can be extended with multiline strings or data tables.</li>
<li>You can organize features into subfolders, like chapters in a book.</li>
<li>Tags allow you to mark up scenarios and features so you select particular sets to run or report on.</li>

<p>Line 1 compiles the CheckoutSteps class that we’ve just created. Then line 2 invokes Cucumber. There are two slight additions to Cucumber’s invocation:</p>
<ol>
<li>We’ve added the current directory “.” to the classpath.</li>
<li>We’ve added the -g step_definitions command-line argument to tell Cucumber where to look for the step definitions that it will need to “glue” the steps in the feature file to the checkout application (which we haven’t written yet).</li>

<p>The first line of this file starts with the keyword Feature: followed by a name. It’s a good idea to use a name similar to the file name.</p>
<p>The second line is a brief description of the feature. Cucumber does not execute this line, it’s just documentation.</p>
<p>The fourth line, Scenario: Sunday is not Friday is a Scenario, which is a concrete example illustrating how the software should behave.</p>
<p>The last three lines starting with Given, When and Then are the steps of our scenario. This is what Cucumber will execute.</p>

<h2 id="Doc-Strings"><a href="#Doc-Strings" class="headerlink" title="Doc Strings"></a>Doc Strings</h2><p>Doc strings allow you to specify a larger piece of text than you could fit on a single line. For example, if you need to describe the precise content of an email message, you could do it like this:<br>Scenario: Ban Unscrupulous Users<br>When I behave unscrupulously<br>Then I should receive an email containing:<br>“””<br>    Dear Sir,<br>    Your account privileges have been revoked due to your unscrupulous behavior.<br>Sincerely,<br>The Management “””<br>And my account should be locked<br>Just like a data table, the entire string between the “”” triple quotes is attached to the step above it. The indentation of the opening “”” is not important, although common practice is to indent two spaces from the enclosing step, as we’ve shown. The indentation inside the triple quotes, however, is signifi- cant: imagine the left margin running down from the start of the first “””. If you want to include indentation within your string, you need to indent it within this margin.</p>
<h3 id="TGIF"><a href="#TGIF" class="headerlink" title="TGIF"></a>TGIF</h3><p>Thanks God It’s Friday</p>

<p>That’s much clearer. The table starts on the line immediately following the step, and its cells are separated using the pipe character: |. You can line up the pipes using whitespace to make the table look tidy, although Cucumber doesn’t mind whether you do; it will strip out the values in each cell, ignoring the surrounding whitespace.</p>

<p>Our refactoring hasn’t changed the behavior of the tests at all: at runtime, the steps in the background are executed at the beginning of each scenario, just as they were before. What we have done is made each individual scenario much easier to read.</p>
<p>Using a Background element isn’t always necessary, but it’s often useful to improve the readability of your features by removing repetitive steps from individual scenarios. </p>
<h2 id="A-good-‘background’"><a href="#A-good-‘background’" class="headerlink" title="A good ‘background’"></a>A good ‘background’</h2><ul>
<li>Make your Background section vivid. Use colorful names and try to tell a story, because your readers can keep track of stories much better than they can keep track of dull names like User A, User B, Site 1, and so on. If it’s worth mentioning at all, make it really stand out.</li>
<li>Keep your scenarios short, and don’t have too many. If the Background is more than three or four steps long, think about using higher-level steps or splitting the feature file in two. You can use a background as a good indicator of when a feature is getting too long: if the new scenarios you want to add don’t fit with the existing background, consider splitting the feature.</li>
<li>Avoid putting technical details such as clearing queues, starting back- end services, or opening browsers in a background. </li>
</ul>
<p>Backgrounds are useful for taking Given (and sometimes When) steps that are repeated in each scenario and moving them to a single place. This helps keep your scenarios clear and concise.</p>
<h2 id="Discovery-Workshops"><a href="#Discovery-Workshops" class="headerlink" title="Discovery Workshops"></a>Discovery Workshops</h2><p>Discovery workshops (or Specification workshops) are short and frequent meetings where business and IT meet to gain a common understanding of how the software should behave.</p>
<h2 id="Relationship-with-TDD"><a href="#Relationship-with-TDD" class="headerlink" title="Relationship with TDD"></a>Relationship with TDD</h2><p>The main difference is that Cucumber operates on a higher abstraction level, closer to the domain and farther away from classes and methods. BDD builds on TDD, while preserving a strong link between the business requirements and the technical solution.</p>
<h2 id="Outside-in"><a href="#Outside-in" class="headerlink" title="Outside in"></a>Outside in</h2><p>This technique is called Outside-in because programmers typically start with the functionality that is closest to the user (the user interface, which is on the outside of the system) and gradually work towards the guts of the system (business logic, persistence, messaging and so on) as they discover more of what needs to be implemented.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your cucumber features should drive your implementation, not reflect it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means Cucumber features should be written before the code implementing the feature.</p>
<p>Notice that we’re just sketching out the interface to the class, rather than adding any implementation to it. This way of working is fundamental to out- side-in development. We try not to think about how the Account is going to work yet but concentrate on what it should be able to do.</p>
<p>Keeping specifications, regression tests and documentation in a single place reduces the overhead of keeping multiple documents in sync - the Cucumber scenarios work as a shared source of truth for business and IT.</p>
<p>While many people focus on the value added by the automated “tests” you get out of BDD, the real value is actually the shared understanding we get at the beginning.</p>
<p>Cucumber is not a tool for testing software. It is a tool for testing people’s understanding of how software (yet to be written) should behave.</p>
<p>The biggest advantage of BDD approach for software development might be that they describe a set of functions that a user expects from a system in a very concrete and direct manner. The sum of these behaviors essentially document a contract with the user/client. If any of the tests fail, this contract is not upheld.</p>
<h1 id="Process"><a href="#Process" class="headerlink" title="Process"></a>Process</h1><p>the most important stage of BDD. Three amigos (business persons, developers, testers) get together and identify the expected behavior of our product by discussing examples. We can use feature mapping approach to effectively analyse and elaborate the product behavior.</p>
<p>always make sure that your scenarios are not tightly coupled with your tests. Your BDD scenarios should change only when the requirement changes, not when the the implementation changes (i.e. your BDD scenarios must drive the implementation, not the other way around).</p>
<h1 id="Executable-Specification"><a href="#Executable-Specification" class="headerlink" title="Executable Specification"></a>Executable Specification</h1><p>An Executable Specification is a Definition of Done that you can run as a test. In Behavior Driven Development (BDD), we refer to acceptance criteria as “executable specifications.” Executable Specifications are meant to be clear, unambiguous, written in business terms, and easy to automate. Each acceptance criteria is a concrete example of how a user interacts with the system to achieve some business goal.</p>
<p>The most well-known format for BDD acceptance criteria uses the “Given-When-Then” structure:</p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Given &lt;some precondition&gt;</span><br><span class="line">When &lt;something happens&gt;</span><br><span class="line">Then &lt;we expect some outcome&gt;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>This format is a great way to make sure that we are thinking in terms of the outcomes we want to achieve. After all, the outcomes of an application are where the value lies.</p>
<p>These scenarios are also easy to automate with BDD tools like Cucumber and Specflow.</p>
<h1 id="No-silver-bullet"><a href="#No-silver-bullet" class="headerlink" title="No silver bullet"></a>No silver bullet</h1><p>“The hardest single part of building a software system is deciding precisely what to build.”<br>We’ve all worked on projects where, because of a misunderstanding, code that we’d worked hard on for several days or more had to be thrown away. Better communication between developers and stakeholders is essential to help avoid this kind of wasted time. One technique that really helps facilitate this communication is the use of concrete examples to illustrate what we want the software to do.</p>
<h2 id="Concrete-Examples"><a href="#Concrete-Examples" class="headerlink" title="Concrete Examples"></a>Concrete Examples</h2><p>By using real-world examples to describe the desired behavior of the system we want to build, we stay grounded in language and terminology that makes sense to our stakeholders: we’re speaking their language. </p>
<p>To illustrate this, let’s imagine you’re building a credit card payment system. One of the requirements is to make sure users can’t enter bad data. Here’s one way of expressing that:<br><code>Customers should be prevented from entering invalid credit card details.</code><br>This is an example of what Agile teams often call acceptance criteria or condi- tions of satisfaction.1 We use the word acceptance because they tell us what the system must be able to do in order for our stakeholders to find it acceptable.</p>
<p>The previous requirements statement is useful, but it leaves far too much room for ambiguity and misunderstanding. It lacks precision. What exactly makes a set of details invalid? How exactly should the user be prevented from entering them? We’ve seen too many projects get dragged into the tar pit2 by these kind of worthy but vague statements. Let’s try illustrating this requirement with a concrete example:<br><code>If a customer enters a credit card number that isn’t exactly 16 digits long, when they try to submit the form, it should be redisplayed with an error message advising them of the correct number of digits.</code></p>
<p>Can you see how much more specific this second statement is? As a developer implementing this feature, we know almost everything we need to be able to sit down and start working on the code. As a stakeholder, we have a much clearer idea of what the developer is going to build.<br>In fact, a stakeholder reading this might point out that there are certain types of cards that are valid with fewer than 16 digits and give us another example. This is the real power of examples: they stimulate our imagination, enabling us to explore and discover edge cases we might otherwise not have found until much later.</p>
<p>By giving an example to illustrate our requirement, we’ve turned an acceptance criterion into an acceptance test. Now we have something unambiguous that we can use to test the behavior of the system, either manually or by using an automated test script.</p>
<h1 id="Gherkins"><a href="#Gherkins" class="headerlink" title="Gherkins"></a>Gherkins</h1><p>Gherkin use main keywords: Feature, Scenario, Given, When, Then, And, But, Background, Scenario Outline, Examplesand some extra syntax “”” (Doc strings), | (Data tables), @(Tags), # (Comments).</p>

<p>The –dry-run switch tells Cucumber to parse the file without executing it. It<br>will tell you if your Gherkin isn’t valid.</p>
<h1 id="Replacing-Given-When-Then-with-Bullets"><a href="#Replacing-Given-When-Then-with-Bullets" class="headerlink" title="Replacing Given/When/Then with Bullets"></a>Replacing Given/When/Then with Bullets</h1><p>Some people find Given, When, Then, And, and But a little verbose. There is an additional keyword you can use to start a step: * (an asterisk). We could have written the previous scenario like this:<br>Scenario: Attempt withdrawal using stolen card * I have $100 in my account</p>
<ul>
<li>my card is invalid</li>
<li>I request $50</li>
<li>my card should not be returned</li>
<li>I should be told to contact the bank<br>To Cucumber, this is exactly the same scenario. Do you find this version easier to read? Maybe. Did some of the meaning get lost? Maybe. It’s up to you and your team how you want to word things. The only thing that matters is that everybody understands what’s communicated.</li>

<h3 id="Step-definitions"><a href="#Step-definitions" class="headerlink" title="Step definitions"></a>Step definitions</h3><p>Cucumber doesn’t know how to execute your scenarios out-of-the-box.

<h3 id="After"><a href="#After" class="headerlink" title="After"></a>After</h3><p>one can implement initial configurations of the project in TestNG’s BeforeClass method. In cucumber’s Before hook, one can implement code to open web browser which is a prerequisite for all scenarios. In Background of each feature, one can implement steps to navigate to web site and/or login to account. In Cucumber’s After hook, one can take a snapshot of failure and close the browser.</p>
<h2 id="tags"><a href="#tags" class="headerlink" title="tags"></a>tags</h2><p>Grouping Features, Scenarios, and Step Definitions using Tags<br>Tags is a great way made for Cucumber power users to organize their features and scenarios. In above example, by changing tags = {“~@Ignore”} line totags = {“@UpdateProfile”}, one can choose run only the features and scenarios tagged with @UpdateProfile tag. A Scenario or feature can have as many tags as you like. Just separate them with spaces: @important @maintenance @db @auth</p>
<p>If subfolders are the chapters in your book of features, then tags are the sticky notes you’ve put on pages you want to be able to find easily. You tag a scenario by putting a word prefixed with the @ character on the line before the Scenario keyword, like this:<br>@widgets<br>Scenario: Generate report<br>Given I am logged in</p>
<p>There are three main reasons for tagging scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Documentation: You want to use a tag to attach a label to certain scenarios, for example to label them with an ID from a project management tool.</li>
<li>Filtering: Cucumber allows you to use tags as a filter to pick out specific scenarios to run or report on. You can even have Cucumber fail your test run if a certain tag appears too many times.</li>
<li>Hooks: Run a block of code whenever a scenario with a particular tag is about to start or has just finished.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="config-tag"><a href="#config-tag" class="headerlink" title="config tag"></a>config tag</h3><p>Tags are a great way to organise your features and scenarios. Consider this example:</p>
<p>@billing<br>Feature: Verify billing</p>
<p>  @important<br>  Scenario: Missing product description<br>    Given hello</p>
<p>  Scenario: Several products<br>    Given hello<br>A feature or scenario or can have as many tags as you like. Just separate them with spaces:</p>
<p>@billing @bicker @annoy<br>Feature: Verify billing<br>Tags can be placed above the following Gherkin elements:</p>
<p>Feature<br>Scenario<br>Scenario Outline<br>Examples<br>It is not possible to place tags above Background or steps (Given, When, Then, And and But).</p>
<h1 id="Cucumber-for-java-8-lambda"><a href="#Cucumber-for-java-8-lambda" class="headerlink" title="Cucumber for java 8 lambda"></a>Cucumber for java 8 lambda</h1><p>Using Lambda Expressions for Step Definitions<br>Java Step Definitions are written in regular classes which don’t need to extend or implement anything. They can be written either using lambda expressions or method annotations. In the above, we used the method annotations. To use lambda expressions, use cucumber-java8 module instead of cucumber-java module in your pom.xml file.</p>
<p>When you use the cucumber-java8 module, you can write the Step Definitions using lambdas:</p>

<h1 id="Gherkin-1"><a href="#Gherkin-1" class="headerlink" title="Gherkin"></a>Gherkin</h1><p>Cucumber tests are expressed using a syntax called Gherkin. Gherkin files are plain text and have a .feature extension.</p>
<h1 id="Steps-and-Step-Definitions"><a href="#Steps-and-Step-Definitions" class="headerlink" title="Steps and Step Definitions"></a>Steps and Step Definitions</h1><p>Let’s start by clarifying the distinction between a step and a step definition.<br>Each Gherkin scenario is made up of a series of steps, written in plain lan- guage. On its own, a step is just documentation; it needs a step definition to bring it to life. A step definition is a piece of code that says to Cucumber, “If you see a step that looks like this…, then here’s what I want you to do….”<br>When Cucumber tries to execute each step, it looks for a matching step defi- nition to execute. So, how does Cucumber match a step definition to a step?</p>
<h1 id="Creating-a-Step-Definition"><a href="#Creating-a-Step-Definition" class="headerlink" title="Creating a Step Definition"></a>Creating a Step Definition</h1><p>If Cucumber sees a step definition with this regular expression, it will execute it when it comes to the first step of our scenario. So, how do we create a step definition?</p>
<p>Step definitions live in ordinary files. To create a step definition in Java, you use a special Cucumber annotation, such as @Given, like this:<br>@Given(“I have \$100 in my Account”)<br>public void iHave$100InMyAccount() throws Throwable {<br>    // TODO: code that puts $100 into User’s Account goes here<br>}</p>
<h2 id="Given-When-Then-Are-the-Same"><a href="#Given-When-Then-Are-the-Same" class="headerlink" title="Given, When, Then Are the Same"></a>Given, When, Then Are the Same</h2><p>It doesn’t actually matter which of the three methods you use to register a step definition, because Cucumber ignores the keyword when matching a step. Under the hood, all of the annotations are aliases for StepDefAnnotation.</p>
<p>The best way we’ve found to avoid this kind of problem is to pay careful attention to the precise wording in your steps. You could change both steps to be less ambiguous:<br>Given I have deposited $100 in my Account Then the balance of my Account should be $100<br>By rewording the steps like this, you’ve made them better at communicating exactly what they will do when executed. Learning to spot and remove this kind of ambiguity is something that takes practice. Paying attention to the distinction in wording between two steps like this can also give you hints about concepts that may not be expressed in your code but need to be. It might seem pedantic, but we’ve found that teams who pay this much careful attention to detail write much better software, faster.</p>
<h3 id="Alternation"><a href="#Alternation" class="headerlink" title="Alternation"></a>Alternation</h3><p>We can specify a wildcard in a regular expression using a few different approaches. One of the simplest is alternation, where we express different options separated by a pipe character |, like this:</p>
<figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">@Given</span>(<span class="string">"I have deposited \\$(100|250) in my Account"</span>) <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> iHaveDeposited$InMyAccount(<span class="keyword">int</span> amount) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// <span class="doctag">TODO:</span> code goes here</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>This step definition will now match a step with either of the two values 100 or 250 in it, and the number will be captured and passed to the method as an argument. Alternation can be useful if there are a fixed set of values that you want to accept in your step definition, but normally you’ll want something a little looser.</p>
<h3 id="The-Dot"><a href="#The-Dot" class="headerlink" title="The Dot"></a>The Dot</h3><p>The dot is a metacharacter, meaning it has magical powers in a regular expression. Literally, a dot means match any single character. So, we can try this instead:</p>
<figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">@Given</span>(<span class="string">"I have deposited \\$(...) in my Account"</span>) <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> iHaveDeposited$InMyAccount(<span class="keyword">int</span> amount) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// <span class="doctag">TODO:</span> code goes here</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>That will now match a step with any three-figure dollar sum and send the matched amount into the method. </p>
<h4 id="What-If-I-Actually-Want-to-Match-a-Dot"><a href="#What-If-I-Actually-Want-to-Match-a-Dot" class="headerlink" title="What If I Actually Want to Match a Dot?"></a>What If I Actually Want to Match a Dot?</h4><p>Any of the metacharacters like the dot can be escaped by preceding them with a backslash. So, if you wanted to specifically match, say 3.14, you could use “3\.14”.<br>You might have noticed that there’s a backslash in front of the dollar amount in the step definition we’re using. That’s because $ itself is a metacharacter (it’s an anchor, which we’ll explain later), so we need to escape to make it match a normal dollar sign.</p>
<h2 id="Star-modifier"><a href="#Star-modifier" class="headerlink" title="Star modifier"></a>Star modifier</h2><p>The star modifier means any number of times. So, with .* we’re capturing any character, any number of times. Now we’re getting somewhere—this will allow us to capture all those different amounts. But there’s still a problem.<br>The star modifier is a bit of a blunt instrument. Because we’re using it with the dot that matches any character, it will gobble up any text at all up until the phrase in my Account. This is why, in regex terminology, the star modifier is known as a greedy operator. For example, it would happily match this step:<br>Given I have deposited $1 and a cucumber in my Account<br>The amount captured by our regular expression in this case would be 1 and a cucumber. We need to be more specific about the characters we want to match and just capture numbers. Instead of a dot, we can use something else.</p>
<h3 id="Character-Classes"><a href="#Character-Classes" class="headerlink" title="Character Classes"></a>Character Classes</h3><p>Character classes allow you to tell the regular expression engine to match one of a range of characters. You just place all of the characters you would accept inside square brackets:</p>
<figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">@Given</span>(<span class="string">"I have deposited \\$([01234567890]*) in my Account"</span>) <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> iHaveDeposited$InMyAccount(<span class="keyword">int</span> amount) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// <span class="doctag">TODO:</span> code goes here</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line">For a continuous range of characters like we have, you can use a hyphen:</span><br><span class="line"><span class="meta">@Given</span>(<span class="string">"I have deposited \\$([0-9]*) in my Account"</span>) <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> iHaveDeposited$InMyAccount(<span class="keyword">int</span> amount) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// <span class="doctag">TODO:</span> code goes here</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<h3 id="Shorthand-Character-Classes"><a href="#Shorthand-Character-Classes" class="headerlink" title="Shorthand Character Classes"></a>Shorthand Character Classes</h3><p>For common patterns of characters like [0-9], there are a few shorthand char- acter classes that you can use instead. You may find this just makes your regular expressions more cryptic, but there are only a few to learn. For a digit, you can use \d as a shorthand for [0-9]:</p>
<figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">@Given</span>(<span class="string">"I have deposited \\$(\\d*) in my Account"</span>) <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> iHaveDeposited$InMyAccount(<span class="keyword">int</span> amount) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  <span class="comment">// <span class="doctag">TODO:</span> code goes here</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Here are the most useful shorthand character classes: \d stands for digit, or [0-9].<br>\w stands for word character, specifically [A-Za-z0-9_]. Notice that underscores and digits are included but not hyphens.<br>\s stands for whitespace character, specifically [ \t\r\n]. That means a space, a tab, or a line break.<br>\b stands for word boundary, which is a lot like \s but actually means the opposite of \w. Anything that is not a word character is a word boundary.<br>You can also negate shorthand character classes by capitalizing them, so for example, \D means any character except a digit.<br>Back to matching our amount. It looks like we’re done, but there’s one last problem to fix. Can you see what it is?</p>
<h3 id="question-mark"><a href="#question-mark" class="headerlink" title="question mark"></a>question mark</h3><p>Like the star and the plus, the question mark modifies the character that precedes it, specifying how many times it can be repeated. The question mark modifier means zero or one times; in other words, it makes the preceding character optional. In step definitions, it’s particularly useful for plurals:<br>@Given(“I have (\d+) cucumbers? in my basket”) public void iHaveCucumbersInMyBasket(int number) {<br>  // TODO: code goes here<br>}</p>
<h3 id="noncapturing-group"><a href="#noncapturing-group" class="headerlink" title="noncapturing group"></a>noncapturing group</h3><p>@When(“I (?:visit|go to) the homepage”) public void iVisitTheHomepage() {<br>  // TODO: code goes here<br>}
Notice that we’ve had to prefix the list of alternates with another bit of regular expression magic. The ?: at the start of the group marks it as noncapturing, meaning Cucumber won’t pass it as an argument to our block.</p>
<h3 id="Anchors"><a href="#Anchors" class="headerlink" title="Anchors"></a>Anchors</h3><p>The undefined steps start with a ^ and end with a $. These two metacharacters are called anchors, because they’re used to tie down each end of the regular expression to the beginning and end of the string that they match on.</p>
<p>Generally, it’s best to keep your regular expressions as tight as you can so that there’s less chance of two step definitions clashing with each other.</p>
<h1 id="Guides-on-how-to-write-scenarios"><a href="#Guides-on-how-to-write-scenarios" class="headerlink" title="Guides on how to write scenarios"></a>Guides on how to write scenarios</h1><p>Try to avoid being guided by existing step definitions when you write your scenarios and just write down exactly what you want to happen, in plain English. In fact, try to avoid programmers or testers writing scenarios on their own. Instead, get nontechnical stakeholders or analysts to write the first draft of each scenario from a purely business-focused perspective or ideally in a pair with a programmer to help them share their mental model. With a well- engineered support layer, you can confidently and quickly write new step definitions to match the way the scenario has been expressed.</p>
<h1 id="Imperative-Steps"><a href="#Imperative-Steps" class="headerlink" title="Imperative Steps"></a>Imperative Steps</h1><p>In computer programming, there are two contrasting styles for expressing the instructions you give to a computer to make it do something for you. These styles are called imperative programming and declarative programming.</p>
<p>Imperative programming means using a sequence of commands for the com- puter to perform in a particular order. Java is an example of an imperative language: you write a program as a series of statements that Java runs one at a time, in order. A declarative program tells the computer what it should do without prescribing precisely how to do it. CSS is an example of a declar- ative language: you tell the computer what you want the various elements on a web page to look like, and you leave it to take care of the rest.</p>
<h2 id="Use-a-Declarative-Style-Instead"><a href="#Use-a-Declarative-Style-Instead" class="headerlink" title="Use a Declarative Style Instead"></a>Use a Declarative Style Instead</h2><p>Let’s raise the level of abstraction in this scenario and rewrite it using a more declarative style:<br>Scenario: Redirect user to originally requested page after logging in Given I am an unauthenticated User<br>When I attempt to view some restricted content<br>Then I am shown a login form<br>When I authenticate with valid credentials Then I should be shown the restricted content<br>The beauty of this style is that it is not coupled to any specific implementation of the user interface. This same scenario could apply to a thick-client or mobile application. The words it uses aren’t technical and are instead written in a language (unauthenticated, restricted, credentials) that any stakeholder interested in security should be able to clearly understand. It’s by expressing every scenario at this level of abstraction that you discover your team’s ubiquitous language.</p>
<h1 id="DAMP"><a href="#DAMP" class="headerlink" title="DAMP"></a>DAMP</h1><p>However, when you are using examples to drive your code, there is another principle in play that I believe trumps the DRY principle: the examples should tell a good story. They are the docu- mentation narrative that will guide future programmers (including you when you come back to change this code in three months time and you’ve forgotten what it does). In this case, clarity of intent is found in the quality of the narrative, not necessarily in minimizing duplication.</p>
<p>Some people refer to this as the DAMP principle: Descriptive and Meaningful Phrases. When you’re writing examples, readability is paramount, and DAMP trumps DRY.</p>
<p>We consider fixture data to be an antipattern. We much prefer using Test Data Builders, on page 104, where the relevant data is created within the test itself, rather than being buried away in a big tangled set of fixture data.</p>
<p>We find that teams that have a single humongous build also tend to have an architecture that could best be described as a big ball of mud. Because all of the behavior in the system is implemented in one place, all the tests have to live in one place, too, and have to all be run together as one big lump. This is a classic ailment of long-lived applications, which have grown organically without obvious interfaces between their subsystems.</p>
<h1 id="Defect-Prevention"><a href="#Defect-Prevention" class="headerlink" title="Defect Prevention"></a>Defect Prevention</h1><p>Toyota’s counterintuitive but hugely successful policy of stopping the line works because it’s part of a wider process, known as defect prevention, that focuses on continuously improving the manufacturing system. Without this wider process, stop the line itself would have very little effect. There are four steps to this process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Detect the abnormality.</li>
<li>Stop what you’re doing.</li>
<li>Fix or correct the immediate problem.</li>
<li>Investigate the root cause and install a countermeasure.<br>This fourth step is crucial because it seizes the opportunity offered by the problem at hand to understand something more fundamental about your process. It also means that fixing things becomes a habit, rather than some- thing you put off to do someday later when you’re not in such a hurry.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cucumber might just seem like a testing tool, but at its heart it’s really a collaboration tool. If you make a genuine effort to write features that work as documentation for the nontechnical stakeholders on your team, you’ll find you are forced to talk with them about details that you might never have otherwise made the time to talk about. Those conversations reveal insights about their understanding of the problem, insights that will help you build a much better solution than you would have otherwise. This is Cucumber’s big secret: the tests and documentation are just a happy side effect; the real value lies in the knowledge you discover during those conversations.</p>

            <h1 id="Sudo-in-a-Nutshell"><a href="#Sudo-in-a-Nutshell" class="headerlink" title="Sudo in a Nutshell"></a>Sudo in a Nutshell</h1><p>Sudo (su “do”) allows a system administrator to give certain users (or groups of users) the ability to run some (or all) commands as root while logging all commands and arguments. Sudo operates on a per-command basis, it is not a replacement for the shell. Its features include:</p>
<p>The ability to restrict what commands a user may run on a per-host basis.<br>Sudo does copious logging of each command, providing a clear audit trail of who did what. When used in tandem with syslogd, the system log daemon, sudo can log all commands to a central host (as well as on the local host). At CU, all admins use sudo in lieu of a root shell to take advantage of this logging.<br>Sudo uses timestamp files to implement a “ticketing” system. When a user invokes sudo and enters their password, they are granted a ticket for 5 minutes (this timeout is configurable at compile-time). Each subsequent sudo command updates the ticket for another 5 minutes. This avoids the problem of leaving a root shell where others can physically get to your keyboard. There is also an easy way for a user to remove their ticket file, useful for placing in a .logout file.<br>Sudo’s configuration file, the sudoers file, is setup in such a way that the same sudoers file may be used on many machines. This allows for central administration while keeping the flexibility to define a user’s privileges on a per-host basis. Please see the samples sudoers file below for a real-world example.</p>
<h1 id="sudo-conf"><a href="#sudo-conf" class="headerlink" title="sudo.conf"></a>sudo.conf</h1><p>The sudo.conf file is used to configure the sudo front end. It specifies the security policy and I/O logging plugins, debug flags as well as plugin-agnostic path names and settings.</p>
<p>sudo supports a plugin architecture for security policies and input/output logging. Third parties can develop and distribute their own policy and I/O logging plugins to work seamlessly with the sudo front end. Plugins are dynamically loaded based on the contents of sudo.conf.<br>A Plugin line consists of the Plugin keyword, followed by the symbol_name and the path to the dynamic shared object that contains the plugin. The symbol_name is the name of the struct policy_plugin or struct io_plugin symbol contained in the plugin. The path may be fully qualified or relative. If not fully qualified, it is relative to the directory specified by the plugin_dir Path setting, which defaults to /usr/local/libexec/sudo. In other words:<br>Plugin sudoers_policy sudoers.so<br>is equivalent to:<br>Plugin sudoers_policy /usr/local/libexec/sudo/sudoers.so</p>
<h2 id="Configurations"><a href="#Configurations" class="headerlink" title="Configurations"></a>Configurations</h2><ul>
<li><p>sudoers_file=pathname<br>The sudoers_file argument can be used to override the default path to the sudoers file.</p>
</li>
<li><p>sudoers_uid=uid<br>The sudoers_uid argument can be used to override the default owner of the sudoers file. It should be specified as a numeric user ID.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="email-notification"><a href="#email-notification" class="headerlink" title="email notification"></a>email notification</h1><p>If a user who is not listed in the policy tries to run a command via sudo, mail is sent to the proper authorities. The address used for such mail is configurable via the mailto Defaults entry (described later) and defaults to root.</p>
<p>Note that no mail will be sent if an unauthorized user tries to run sudo with the -l or -v option unless there is an authentication error and either the mail_always or mail_badpass flags are enabled. This allows users to determine for themselves whether or not they are allowed to use sudo. All attempts to run sudo (successful or not) will be logged, regardless of whether or not mail is sent.</p>
<p>sudoers uses per-user time stamp files for credential caching. Once a user has been authenticated, a record is written containing the user ID that was used to authenticate, the terminal session ID, the start time of the session leader (or parent process) and a time stamp (using a monotonic clock if one is available). The user may then use sudo without a password for a short period of time (5 minutes unless overridden by the timestamp_timeout option). By default, sudoers uses a separate record for each terminal, which means that a user’s login sessions are authenticated separately. The timestamp_type option can be used to select the type of time stamp record sudoers will use.</p>
<h1 id="File-format"><a href="#File-format" class="headerlink" title="File format"></a>File format</h1><p>The sudoers file is composed of two types of entries: aliases (basically variables) and user specifications (which specify who may run what).</p>
<p>When multiple entries match for a user, they are applied in order. Where there are multiple matches, the last match is used (which is not necessarily the most specific match).<br>The sudoers file grammar will be described below in Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF). Don’t despair if you are unfamiliar with EBNF; it is fairly simple, and the definitions below are annotated.</p>
<h1 id="environment"><a href="#environment" class="headerlink" title="environment"></a>environment</h1><p>By default, the env_reset option is enabled. This causes commands to be executed with a new, minimal environment.</p>
<p>Lists have two additional assignment operators, += and -=. These operators are used to add to and delete from a list respectively. It is not an error to use the -= operator to remove an element that does not exist in a list.</p>

            <h1 id="What-are-protocol-buffers"><a href="#What-are-protocol-buffers" class="headerlink" title="What are protocol buffers?"></a>What are protocol buffers?</h1><p>Protocol buffers are a flexible, efficient, automated mechanism for serializing structured data – think XML, but smaller, faster, and simpler.</p>
<p>You define how you want your data to be structured once, then you can use special generated source code to easily write and read your structured data to and from a variety of data streams and using a variety of languages. You can even update your data structure without breaking deployed programs that are compiled against the “old” format.</p>
<h1 id="How-do-they-work"><a href="#How-do-they-work" class="headerlink" title="How do they work?"></a>How do they work?</h1><p>You specify how you want the information you’re serializing to be structured by defining protocol buffer message types in .proto files. Each protocol buffer message is a small logical record of information, containing a series of name-value pairs. </p>
<figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br><span class="line">11</span><br><span class="line">12</span><br><span class="line">13</span><br><span class="line">14</span><br><span class="line">15</span><br><span class="line">16</span><br><span class="line">17</span><br><span class="line">18</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">message Person &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  required string name = <span class="number">1</span>;</span><br><span class="line">  required int32 id = <span class="number">2</span>;</span><br><span class="line">  optional string email = <span class="number">3</span>;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  <span class="keyword">enum</span> PhoneType &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    MOBILE = <span class="number">0</span>;</span><br><span class="line">    HOME = <span class="number">1</span>;</span><br><span class="line">    WORK = <span class="number">2</span>;</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  message PhoneNumber &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    required string number = <span class="number">1</span>;</span><br><span class="line">    optional PhoneType type = <span class="number">2</span> [<span class="keyword">default</span> = HOME];</span><br><span class="line">  &#125;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">  repeated PhoneNumber phone = <span class="number">4</span>;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>As you can see, the message format is simple – each message type has one or more uniquely numbered fields, and each field has a name and a value type, where value types can be numbers (integer or floating-point), booleans, strings, raw bytes, or even (as in the example above) other protocol buffer message types, allowing you to structure your data hierarchically. You can specify optional fields, required fields, and repeated fields. </p>
<h1 id="Why-not-just-use-XML"><a href="#Why-not-just-use-XML" class="headerlink" title="Why not just use XML?"></a>Why not just use XML?</h1><p>Protocol buffers have many advantages over XML for serializing structured data. Protocol buffers:</p>
<ul>
<li>are simpler</li>
<li>are 3 to 10 times smaller</li>
<li>are 20 to 100 times faster</li>
<li>are less ambiguous</li>
<li>generate data access classes that are easier to use programmatically</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Assigning-Field-Numbers"><a href="#Assigning-Field-Numbers" class="headerlink" title="Assigning Field Numbers"></a>Assigning Field Numbers</h1><p>As you can see, each field in the message definition has a unique number. These numbers are used to identify your fields in the message binary format, and should not be changed once your message type is in use. Note that field numbers in the range 1 through 15 take one byte to encode, including the field number and the field’s type (you can find out more about this in Protocol Buffer Encoding). Field numbers in the range 16 through 2047 take two bytes. So you should reserve the field numbers 1 through 15 for very frequently occurring message elements. Remember to leave some room for frequently occurring elements that might be added in the future.</p>
<h1 id="Field-Rules"><a href="#Field-Rules" class="headerlink" title="Field Rules"></a>Field Rules</h1><p>You specify that message fields are one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>required: a well-formed message must have exactly one of this field.</li>
<li>optional: a well-formed message can have zero or one of this field (but not more than one).</li>
<li>repeated: this field can be repeated any number of times (including zero) in a well-formed message. The order of the repeated values will be preserved.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Some engineers at Google have come to the conclusion that using required does more harm than good; they prefer to use only optional and repeated. However, this view is not universal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Combining Messages leads to bloat While multiple message types (such as message, enum, and service) can be defined in a single .proto file, it can also lead to dependency bloat when large numbers of messages with varying dependencies are defined in a single file. It’s recommended to include as few message types per .proto file as possible.</p>
<h1 id="Reserved-fields"><a href="#Reserved-fields" class="headerlink" title="Reserved fields"></a>Reserved fields</h1><p>to make sure this doesn’t happen is to specify that the field numbers (and/or names, which can also cause issues for JSON serialization) of your deleted fields are reserved. The protocol buffer compiler will complain if any future users try to use these field identifiers.</p>
<figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">message Foo &#123;</span><br><span class="line">  reserved <span class="number">2</span>, <span class="number">15</span>, <span class="number">9</span> to <span class="number">11</span>;</span><br><span class="line">  reserved <span class="string">"foo"</span>, <span class="string">"bar"</span>;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<h1 id="Importing-Definitions"><a href="#Importing-Definitions" class="headerlink" title="Importing Definitions"></a>Importing Definitions</h1><p>You can use definitions from other .proto files by importing them. To import another .proto’s definitions, you add an import statement to the top of your file:</p>

<h1 id="Builders-vs-Messages"><a href="#Builders-vs-Messages" class="headerlink" title="Builders vs. Messages"></a>Builders vs. Messages</h1><p>The message classes generated by the protocol buffer compiler are all immutable. Once a message object is constructed, it cannot be modified, just like a Java String. To construct a message, you must first construct a builder, set any fields you want to set to your chosen values, then call the builder’s build() method.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that each method of the builder which modifies the message returns another builder. The returned object is actually the same builder on which you called the method. It is returned for convenience so that you can string several setters together on a single line of code.</p>
<p>Here’s an example of how you would create an instance of Person:</p>

            <h1 id="A-new-type-of-Juice"><a href="#A-new-type-of-Juice" class="headerlink" title="A new type of Juice"></a>A new type of Juice</h1><p>Put simply, Guice alleviates the need for factories and the use of new in your Java code. Think of Guice’s @Inject as the new new. You will still need to write factories in some cases, but your code will not depend directly on them. Your code will be easier to change, unit test and reuse in other contexts.</p>
<p>Guice embraces Java’s type safe nature, especially when it comes to features introduced in Java 5 such as generics and annotations. You might think of Guice as filling in missing features for core Java. Ideally, the language itself would provide most of the same features, but until such a language comes along, we have Guice.</p>
<p>Guice helps you design better APIs, and the Guice API itself sets a good example. Guice is not a kitchen sink. We justify each feature with at least three use cases. When in doubt, we leave it out. We build general functionality which enables you to extend Guice rather than adding every feature to the core framework.</p>
<h1 id="Guice-vs-Spring"><a href="#Guice-vs-Spring" class="headerlink" title="Guice vs Spring"></a>Guice vs Spring</h1><p>Spring and Google Guice are two powerful dependency injection frameworks in use today. Both frameworks fully embrace the concepts of dependency injection, but each has its own way of implementing them. Although Spring provides many benefits, it was created in a pre-Java-5 world. The Guice framework takes DI to the next level.</p>
<p>The advent of Java 5 brought significant changes to the language like generics and annotations: features that enhance the power of Java static typing. Guice is a DI framework that was built from the ground up with the intent to take full advantage of these new features and that has focused on one primary goal: to do dependency injection well.</p>
<p>Guice aims to make development and debugging easier and faster, not harder and slower. In that vein, Guice steers clear of surprises and magic. You should be able to understand code with or without tools, though tools can make things even easier. When errors do occur, Guice goes the extra mile to generate helpful messages.</p>
<h3 id="core-differences-between-the-two-and-see-why-I-prefer-to-use-Guice"><a href="#core-differences-between-the-two-and-see-why-I-prefer-to-use-Guice" class="headerlink" title="core differences between the two, and see why I prefer to use Guice."></a>core differences between the two, and see why I prefer to use Guice.</h3><ol>
<li>Living in XML Hell</li>
<li>Eliminating reliance on String identifiers</li>
<li>Preferring Constructor Injection</li>
</ol>
<p>Although Spring and Guice both support constructor and setter injection, each framework has a preference. Spring has long favored setter injection. Back in the early days of Spring, the authors believed the lack of argument names and default arguments in constructor injection reduced clarity. In addition, constructor injection makes it difficult to have optional dependencies, requires dependencies to be configured in a specific order, and forces subclasses to deal with superclass dependencies. Using setter injection eliminates these problems, and so Spring favors that approach.</p>
<p>The Guice authors saw difficulties with setter injection. One problem is immutability: it is impossible to make immutable a class that uses setter injection. Constructor injection, on the other hand, makes the creation of immutable classes easy, an important consideration in writing multi-threaded applications. In addition, optional dependencies, while perhaps convenient, can introduce confusion about how a class is configured at runtime. Configuring a class through setter injection can often lead to missed required dependencies. Though Spring does provide a @Required annotation to solve this problem, using constructor injection eliminates it by default.</p>
<p>Constructor injection also makes a class’s dependencies immediately clear at a glance. If you’re writing or modifying a unit test, it’s easy to read what the system-under-test needs. Lastly, because Guice uses types to wire classes together, constructor argument order isn’t an issue. You can feel free to reorder them how you want without needing to modify configuration code at all.</p>
<p>The potential drawbacks posed by setter injection outweigh the benefits in many common scenarios, and so Guice established a best practice of favoring constructor injection instead. Its API is well-suited to that approach. But if you should choose to switch from one form of injection to the other, Guice makes that easy too. Changing from setter to constructor injection or vice versa is simply a matter of modifying the class in question. Unlike in Spring, you need never touch a configuration file.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Nullifying NullPointerExceptions</li>
</ol>
<p>Null is easily one of the most non-communicative return values possible from a method call.<br>Guice hates nulls as much as I do. By default, Guice refuses to inject a null into any object, and if an accidental null shows up during wiring, it fails-fast with a ProvisionException. Guice does allow for the exception case by permitting fields to be annotated with @Nullable, but this is discouraged.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Intruding into the domain</li>
</ol>
<p>Guice aims to eliminate all of this boilerplate without sacrificing maintainability.<br>With Guice, you implement modules. Guice passes a binder to your module, and your module uses the binder to map interfaces to implementations. The following module tells Guice to map Service to ServiceImpl in singleton scope:</p>
<figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">       <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">MyModule</span> <span class="keyword">implements</span> <span class="title">Module</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">         <span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">configure</span><span class="params">(Binder binder)</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">          binder.bind(Service.class)</span><br><span class="line">           .to(ServiceImpl.class)</span><br><span class="line">           .in(Scopes.SINGLETON);</span><br><span class="line">&#125; &#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>A module tells Guice what we want to inject. Now, how do we tell Guice where we want it injected? With Guice, you annotate constructors, methods and fields with @Inject.</p>

<h2 id="Guice-vs-Dependency-Injection-By-Hand"><a href="#Guice-vs-Dependency-Injection-By-Hand" class="headerlink" title="Guice vs. Dependency Injection By Hand"></a>Guice vs. Dependency Injection By Hand</h2><p>As you can see, Guice saves you from having to write factory classes. You don’t have to write explicit code wiring clients to their dependencies. If you forget to provide a dependency, Guice fails at startup. Guice handles circular dependencies automatically.<br>Guice enables you to specify scopes declaratively. For example, you don’t have to write the same code to store an object in the HttpSession over and over.<br>In the real world, you often don’t know an implementation class until runtime. You need meta factories or service locators for your factories. Guice addresses these problems with minimal effort.<br>When injecting dependencies by hand, you can easily slip back into old habits and introduce direct dependencies, especially if you’re new to the concept of dependency injection. Using Guice turns the tables and makes doing the right thing easier. Guice helps keep you on track.</p>
<h2 id="Guice-annotations"><a href="#Guice-annotations" class="headerlink" title="Guice annotations"></a>Guice annotations</h2><p>When possible, Guice enables you to use annotations in lieu of explicit bindings and eliminate even more boilerplate code. Back to our example, if you need an interface to simplify unit testing but you don’t care about compile time dependencies, you can point to a default implementation directly from your interface.</p>
<figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">       <span class="meta">@ImplementedBy</span>(ServiceImpl.class)</span><br><span class="line">       <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="class"><span class="keyword">interface</span> <span class="title">Service</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">         <span class="function"><span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">go</span><span class="params">()</span></span>;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>If a client needs a Service and Guice can’t find an explicit binding, Guice will<br>inject an instance of ServiceImpl.</p>
<p>By default, Guice injects a new instance every time. If you want to specify a<br>different scope, you can annotate the implementation class, too.</p>
<figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="meta">@Singleton</span></span><br><span class="line">       <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">ServiceImpl</span> <span class="keyword">implements</span> <span class="title">Service</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">         <span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">go</span><span class="params">()</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">... &#125;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<h1 id="Architectural-Overview"><a href="#Architectural-Overview" class="headerlink" title="Architectural Overview"></a>Architectural Overview</h1><p>We can break Guice’s architecture down into two distinct stages: startup and<br>runtime. You build an Injector during startup and use it to inject objects at runtime.</p>
<h2 id="Startup"><a href="#Startup" class="headerlink" title="Startup"></a>Startup</h2><p>You configure Guice by implementing Module. You pass Guice a module, Guice passes your module a Binder, and your module uses the binder to configure bindings. A binding most commonly consists of a mapping between an interface and a concrete implementation. For example:</p>
<figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">       <span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">MyModule</span> <span class="keyword">implements</span> <span class="title">Module</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">         <span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> <span class="title">configure</span><span class="params">(Binder binder)</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">          <span class="comment">// Bind Foo to FooImpl.

<h1 id="Injecting-Providers"><a href="#Injecting-Providers" class="headerlink" title="Injecting Providers"></a>Injecting Providers</h1><p>With normal dependency injection, each type gets exactly one instance of each of its dependent types. The RealBillingService gets one CreditCardProcessor and one TransactionLog. Sometimes you want more than one instance of your dependent types. When this flexibility is necessary, Guice binds a provider. Providers produce a value when the get() method is invoked:</p>

The method must be defined within a module, and it must have an @Provides annotation. The method’s return type is the bound type. Whenever the injector needs an instance of that type, it will invoke the method.</p>

<p>If the @Provides method has a binding annotation like @PayPal or @Named(“Checkout”), Guice binds the annotated type. Dependencies can be passed in as parameters to the method. The injector will exercise the bindings for each of these before invoking the method.</p>
