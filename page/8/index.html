            <h1 id="Concepts"><a href="#Concepts" class="headerlink" title="Concepts"></a>Concepts</h1><ul>
<li>If you implement Comparable interface and override compareTo() method it <strong>must be consistent with equals()</strong> method i.e. for equal object by equals() method compareTo() must return zero. failing to so will affect contract of SortedSet e.g. TreeSet and SortedMap like TreeMap, which uses compareTo() method for checking equality</li>
<li>Remember to use Collections.reverseOrder() comparator for sorting Object in reverse order or descending order, as shown in this example.</li>
<li>Use Generics while implementing Comparator and Comparable interface, that prevents error of accidentally overloading compareTo() and compare() method instead of overriding it because both of these methods accept Object as a parameter. By using Generics and @Override annotation we effectively remove that subtle error.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Comparable-vs-Comparator"><a href="#Comparable-vs-Comparator" class="headerlink" title="Comparable vs Comparator"></a>Comparable vs Comparator</h1><ol>
<li>Comparator in Java is defined in java.util package while Comparable interface in Java is defined in java.lang package, which very much says that Comparator should be used as an utility to sort objects which Comparable should be provided by default</li>
<li>Comparator interface in Java has method public int compare (Object o1, Object o2) which returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as the first argument is less than, equal to, or greater than the second. While Comparable interface has method public int compareTo(Object o) which returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this object is less than, equal to, or greater than the specified object.</li>
<li>If any class implement Comparable interface in Java then collection of that object either List or Array can be sorted automatically by using  Collections.sort() or Arrays.sort() method and object will be sorted based on there natural order defined by CompareTo method.</li>
<li>Objects which implement Comparable in Java  can be used as keys in a SortedMap like TreeMap or elements in a SortedSet  for example TreeSet, without specifying any Comparator.</li>
<li>Generally you should not use difference of integers to decide output of compareTo method as result of *<em>integer subtraction can overflow *</em> but if you are sure that both operands are positive then its one of the quickest way to compare two objects. </li>
<li>Some time you write code to sort object of a class for which you are not the original author, or you don’t have access to code. In these cases you can not implement Comparable and Comparator is only way to sort those objects.</li>
<li>Beware with the fact that How those object will behave if stored in SorteSet or SortedMap like TreeSet and TreeMap. If an object doesn’t implement Comparable than while putting them into SortedMap, always provided corresponding Comparator which can provide sorting logic.</li>
<li>Comparator has a distinct advantage of being self descriptive  for example if you are writing Comparator to compare two Employees based upon there salary than name that comparator as SalaryComparator, on the other hand compareTo()</li>
</ol>
<p>So in Summary if you want to sort objects based on <strong>natural order then use Comparable</strong> in Java and if you want to *<em>sort on some other attribute of object then use Comparator *</em> in Java.</p>
<h1 id="Samples-of-Java-class"><a href="#Samples-of-Java-class" class="headerlink" title="Samples of Java class"></a>Samples of Java class</h1><ul>
<li>How to Compare String in Java<br>String is immutable in Java and one of the most used value class. For comparing String in Java we should not be worrying because String implements Comparable interface and provides a lexicographic implementation for CompareTo method which compare two strings based on contents of characters or you can say in lexical order. You just need to call String.compareTo(AnotherString) and Java will determine whether specified String is greater than , equal to or less than current object. </li>
<li>Dates are represented by java.util.Date class in Java and like String,  Date also implements Comparable in Java so they will be automatically sorted based on there natural ordering if they got stored in any sorted collection like TreeSet or TreeMap. If you explicitly wants to compare two dates in Java you can call Date.compareTo(AnotherDate) method in Java and it will tell whether specified date is greater than , equal to or less than current String.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Exceptions"><a href="#Exceptions" class="headerlink" title="Exceptions"></a>Exceptions</h1><p>One example where compareTo is not consistent with equals in JDK is BigDecimal class. two BigDecimal number for which compareTo returns zero, equals returns false as clear from following BigDecimal comparison example:</p>
<figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">BigDecimal bd1 = <span class="keyword">new</span> BigDecimal(<span class="string">"2.0"</span>);</span><br><span class="line">BigDecimal bd2 = <span class="keyword">new</span> BigDecimal(<span class="string">"2.00"</span>);</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">System.out.println(<span class="string">"comparing BigDecimal using equals: "</span> + bd1.equals(bd2));</span><br><span class="line">System.out.println(<span class="string">"comparing BigDecimal using compareTo: "</span> + bd1.compareTo(bd2));</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Output:</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">comparing BigDecimal using equals: <span class="keyword">false</span></span><br><span class="line">comparing BigDecimal using compareTo: <span class="number">0</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p> How does it affect BigDecimal ? well if you store these two BigDecimal in HashSet you will end up with duplicates (violation of Set Contract) i.e. two elements while if you store them in TreeSet you will end up with just 1 element because HashSet uses equals to check duplicates while TreeSet uses compareTo to check duplicates. That’s why its suggested to keep compareTo consistent with equals method in java.</p>
<ul>
<li>Another important point to note is don’t use subtraction for comparing integral values because result of subtraction can overflow as every int operation in Java is modulo 2^32. use either Integer.compareTo()  or logical operators for comparison. </li>
<li>In summary compareTo should provide natural ordering and compareTo must be consistent with equals() method in Java. </li>
</ul>

<li>“It is important to note that in the pom.xml file you specify the what and not the how. The pom.xml file can also serve as a documentation tool, conveying your project dependencies and their versions.”</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Concepts"><a href="#Concepts" class="headerlink" title="Concepts"></a>Concepts</h1><h2 id="Life-cycles"><a href="#Life-cycles" class="headerlink" title="Life cycles"></a>Life cycles</h2><p>Maven defines three Lifecycles ֠default, clean and site and each Lifecycle consists of predefined Phases. </p>
<p>The clean argument which we pass to mvn command is phase which is in lifecycle named clean.</p>
<p>Maven Lifecycle Phases clean lifecycle<br>The clean lifecycle contains three phases pre-clean, clean and post-clean .<br>When we invoke command mvn clean, Maven loads Clean Lifecycle and executes the phases pre-clean and clean.<br>We can invoke any of these three phases and all preceding phases up to and including the invoked phase are executed sequentially.</p>
<p>Lifecycle phases can’s do anything by themselves. For example, phase clean by itself doesnӴ have ability or functionality to delete the build directory. It delegate the task to a plugin named maven-clean-plugin. So, lifecycles phases are just some predefined steps which Maven invokes sequentially one after another. As we can see, phases are similar to the steps in a job which are executed one after another.</p>
<h1 id="Concepts-summary"><a href="#Concepts-summary" class="headerlink" title="Concepts summary"></a>Concepts summary</h1><p>Lifecycles, Lifecycle Phases, Plugins and Plugin Goals are the core of Maven. and we summarize the concepts learned so far:<br>Maven comes with three lifecycles ֠default, clean and site.<br>each lifecycle is made up of lifecycle phases and in all, there are 28 phases ֠default 21, clean 3 and site 4.<br>when a lifecycle phase is invoked using mvn command, all preceding phases are executed sequentially one after another.<br>lifecycle phases by themselves doesnӴ have any capabilities to accomplish some task and they rely on plugins to carryout the task.<br>depending on project and packaging type, Maven binds various plugin goals to lifecycle phases and goals carryout the task entrusted to them.</p>
<h3 id="default-lifecycle"><a href="#default-lifecycle" class="headerlink" title="default lifecycle"></a>default lifecycle</h3><p>Default Lifecycle<br>The most important of the three lifecycles is the Default Lifecycle . Maven uses default lifecycle to build, test and distribute the project. Default lifecycle contains 21 phases.</p>
<p>Project may contain resources such as properties, XML configuration files etc., and phases process-resources and process-test-resources copy and process such resources files.<br>The phases compile and test-compile complies the source Java files and test files respectively.<br>The phases package, install, and deploy are used to distribute the project. As we have already seen, the package phase creates JAR file of resources and compiled classes for distribution. The phase install, installs the artifacts of the project i.e jar and pom.xml to the local repository at $HOME/.m2 so that other projects can use them as dependencies. The phase deploy installs the artifacts of the project to a remote repository (probably on Internet) so that a wider group of projects can use it as dependency. We will cover these phases in a later chapter.</p>
<h2 id="goal"><a href="#goal" class="headerlink" title="goal"></a>goal</h2><p>If we see the usage description of mvn command, apart from the options it accepts only two things ֠goal or phase.<br>Maven Lifecycle Phases - mvn usage description</p>
<p>mvn [options] [&lt;goal(s)&gt;] [&lt;phase(s)&gt;]</p>
<p>For example, we can directly compile the source with the following command.<br>$ cd simple-app<br>$ mvn compiler:compile<br>To run a goal with mvn, use the format <plugin prefix>:<goal>. In the above example, compiler:compile, the compiler is plugin prefix of maven-compiler-plugin and compile is the goal name. We can get the prefix of all plugins from Maven Plugin Directory.</goal></plugin></p>
<p>–<br>When we invoke a goal directly, Maven executes just that goal, whereas when we invoke a lifecycle phase all the phases up to that phase are executed. We can see this in action with following example.<br>$ cd simple-app<br>$ mvn clean<br>$ mvn surefire:test</p>
<hr>
<p>In very few situations we invoke plugin goals directly and more often than not, lifecycle phases are preferred.</p>
<p>Lifecycle Phases and Plugin Goals<br>When a lifecycle phase is run, depending on project type and packaging type, Maven binds plugin goals to lifecycle phases.<br>When we run mvn package in a Java Project.</p>
<hr>
<p>To process-resources phase, Maven binds resources goal of maven-resources-plugin and to test phase, it binds test goal of maven-surefire-plugin and so on.<br>Whatӳ happens at package phase is bit interesting. In a Java Project, Maven binds jar goal of maven-jar-plugin. However, when we run the same command in a webapp project, up to test phase Maven binds same goals, but to the package phase Maven binds war goal of maven-war-plugin the war:war instead of jar:jar.</p>
<h3 id="Samples"><a href="#Samples" class="headerlink" title="Samples"></a>Samples</h3><p>For example, consider the command below. The clean and package arguments are build phases, while the dependency:copy-dependencies is a goal (of a plugin).</p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">mvn clean dependency:copy-dependencies package</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>If this were to be executed, the clean phase will be executed first (meaning it will run all preceding phases of the clean lifecycle, plus the clean phase itself), and then the dependency:copy-dependencies goal, before finally executing the package phase (and all its preceding build phases of the default lifecycle).</p>
<p>Moreover, if a goal is bound to one or more build phases, that goal will be called in all those phases.</p>

<h2 id="Plugin"><a href="#Plugin" class="headerlink" title="Plugin"></a>Plugin</h2><p>Maven is ֠at its heart ֠a plugin execution framework; all work is done by plugins.</p>
<p>Plugins are broadly grouped as build plugins and reporting plugins. </p>
<p>Plugins are artifacts that provide goals to Maven. Furthermore, a plugin may have one or more goals wherein each goal represents a capability of that plugin. For example, the Compiler plugin has two goals: compile and testCompile. The former compiles the source code of your main code, while the latter compiles the source code of your test code.</p>
<p>Plugin Goals<br>Maven plugin is a collection of one or more goals which do some task or job. It is also known as Mojo ֠Maven Plain Old Java Object.</p>
<p>Similarly, Maven uses maven-compiler-plugin to compile the source and test files and it provides three goals ֠compiler:compile, compiler:testCompile and compiler:help.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say for now that a plugin is a collection of goals with a general common purpose. For example the jboss-maven-plugin, whose purpose is “deal with various jboss items”.</p>
<p>To configure plugins, we use project build element in pom.xml. The next listing shows the top level elements used to configure a plugin.<br>pom.xml</p>

<ul>
<li>build : defines the project build.</li>
<li>plugins : parent element for one or more <plugin> elements.</plugin></li>
<li>plugin : the plugin to configure.</li>

<h3 id="plugin-execution"><a href="#plugin-execution" class="headerlink" title="plugin execution"></a>plugin execution</h3><p>Firstly demonstrate plugin execution with an example. In Apache Ant, itӳ quite easy to output echo any property or message during the build and many of us frequently use it to understand the build flow or to debug. But, Maven comes with no such feature, and only way to echo any message is to use Ant within Maven. The Apache AntRun Plugin provides the ability to run Ant tasks within Maven.<br>Letӳ configure maven-antrun-plugin to output message to console.<br>simple-app/pom.xml<br>  …<br>  <build><br>    <plugins><br>      <plugin><br>        <artifactid>maven-antrun-plugin</artifactid><br>        <executions><br>          <execution><br>            <goals><br>              <goal>run</goal><br>            </goals><br>            <phase>compile</phase><br>            <configuration><br>              <tasks><br>                <echo>Build Dir: ${project.build.directory}</echo><br>              </tasks><br>            </configuration><br>          </execution><br>        </executions><br>      </plugin><br>    </plugins><br>  </build><br>  …<br>Build the project with  mvn package and it echoes the build directory name in compile phase.</p>
<h4 id="sample"><a href="#sample" class="headerlink" title="sample"></a>sample</h4><p>The clean and package arguments are build phases, while the dependency:copy-dependencies is a goal (of a plugin).</p>
<p>mvn clean dependency:copy-dependencies package<br>If this were to be executed, the clean phase will be executed first (meaning it will run all preceding phases of the clean lifecycle, plus the clean phase itself), and then the dependency:copy-dependencies goal, before finally executing the package phase (and all its preceding build phases of the default lifecycle).</p>
<h4 id="concept"><a href="#concept" class="headerlink" title="concept"></a>concept</h4><p>The element <executions>/<execution> allows you to configure the execution of a plugin goal. With it, you can accomplish the following things.<br>bind a plugin goal to a lifecycle phase.<br>configure plugin parameters of a specific goal.<br>configure plugin parameters of a specific goal such as compiler:compile, surefire:test etc., that are by default binds to a lifecycle phase</execution></executions></p>

Rather than a goal, this is a phase. A phase is a step in the build lifecycle, which is an ordered sequence of phases. When a phase is given, Maven will execute every phase in the sequence up to and including the one defined. For example, if we execute the compile phase, the phases that actually get executed are:</p>
</li>
<li><p>validate</p>
</li>
<li><p>generate-sources</p>
</li>
<li><p>process-sources</p>
</li>
<li><p>generate-resources</p>
</li>
<li><p>process-resources</p>
</li>
<li><p>compile</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Maven Phases<br>Although hardly a comprehensive list, these are the most common default lifecycle phases executed.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>validate: validate the project is correct and all necessary information is available</p>
</li>
<li><p>compile: compile the source code of the project</p>
</li>
<li><p>test: test the compiled source code using a suitable unit testing framework. These tests should not require the code be packaged or deployed</p>
</li>
<li><p>package: take the compiled code and package it in its distributable format, such as a JAR.</p>
</li>
<li><p>integration-test: process and deploy the package if necessary into an environment where integration tests can be run</p>
</li>
<li><p>verify: run any checks to verify the package is valid and meets quality criteria</p>
</li>
<li><p>install: install the package into the local repository, for use as a dependency in other projects locally</p>
</li>
<li><p>deploy: done in an integration or release environment, copies the final package to the remote repository for sharing with other developers and projects.<br>There are two other Maven lifecycles of note beyond the default list above. They are</p>
</li>
<li><p>clean: cleans up artifacts created by prior builds</p>
</li>
<li><p>site: generates site documentation for this project<br>Phases are actually mapped to underlying goals. The specific goals executed per phase is dependant upon the packaging type of the project. For example, package executes jar:jar if the project type is a JAR, and war:war if the project type is - you guessed it - a WAR.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An interesting thing to note is that phases and goals may be executed in sequence.</p>
<p>mvn clean dependency:copy-dependencies package<br>This command will clean the project, copy dependencies, and package the project (executing all phases up to package, of course).</p>

<h1 id="Maven-Settings"><a href="#Maven-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Maven Settings"></a>Maven Settings</h1><p>The settings element in the settings.xml file contains elements used to define values which configure Maven execution in various ways, like the pom.xml, but should not be bundled to any specific project, or distributed to an audience. These include values such as the local repository location, alternate remote repository servers, and authentication information.</p>
<p>There are two locations where a settings.xml file may live:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Maven install: ${maven.home}/conf/settings.xml</li>
<li>A user’s install: ${user.home}/.m2/settings.xml<br>The former settings.xml are also called <code>global settings</code>, the latter settings.xml are referred to as user settings. If both files exists, their contents gets merged, with the user-specific settings.xml being dominant.</li>
</ul>
<p>Tip: If you need to create user-specific settings from scratch, it’s easiest to copy the global settings from your Maven installation to your ${user.home}/.m2 directory. Maven’s default settings.xml is a template with comments and examples so you can quickly tweak it to match your needs.</p>

<li>Convention over configuration is a simple concept. Systems, libraries, and frameworks should assume reasonable defaults without requiring that unnecessary configuration systems should “just work.” Popular frameworks such as Ruby on Rails and EJB3 have started to adhere to these principles in reaction to the configuration complexity of frameworks such as the initial Enterprise JavaBeans? (EJB) specifications. </li>
<li>“Popularized by the Ruby on Rails community, CoC emphasizes sensible defaults, thereby reducing the number of decisions to be made.”</li>
<li>“Gradle’s flexibility, like that of Ant, can be abused, which results in difficult and complex builds.<br>”</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Notes"><a href="#Notes" class="headerlink" title="Notes"></a>Notes</h1><ul>
<li>This is the Project Object Model (POM), a declarative description of a project. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Coordinate"><a href="#Coordinate" class="headerlink" title="Coordinate"></a>Coordinate</h2><ul>
<li>“group, artifact, and version (<strong>GAV</strong>) coordinates”</li>
<li>We’ve highlighted the Maven coordinates for this project: <strong>groupId, artifactId, version and packaging. These combined identifiers make up a project’s coordinates</strong>.[3] Just as in any other coordinate system, a Maven coordinate is an address for a specific point in “space”: from general to specific. Maven pinpoints a project via its coordinates when one project relates to another, either as a dependency, a plugin, or a parent project reference. </li>
<li>Maven coordinates are often written using a colon as a delimiter in the following format: <strong>groupId:artifactId:packaging:version</strong>. </li>
<li>Projects undergoing active development can use a special identifier that marks <strong>a version as a SNAPSHOT</strong>.</li>
<li>The packaging format of a project is also an important component in the Maven coordinates, but it isn’t a part of a project’s unique identifiers. A project’s groupId:artifactId:version make that project unique; you can’t have a project with the same three groupId, artifactId, and version identifiers.</li>
<li><strong>packaging: The type of project, defaulting to jar</strong>, describing the packaged output produced by a project. A project with packaging jar produces a JAR archive; a project with packaging war produces a web application.</li>
<li>The core of Maven is pretty dumb; it doesn’t know how to do much beyond parsing a few XML documents and keeping track of a lifecycle and a few plugins. Maven has been designed to delegate most responsibility to a set of Maven plugins that can affect the Maven lifecycle and offer access to goals. Most of the action in Maven happens in plugin goals that take care of things like compiling source, packaging bytecode, publishing sites, and any other task that needs to happen in a build. </li>
<li>You benefit from the fact that plugins are downloaded from a remote repository and maintained centrally. This is what is meant by universal reuse through Maven plugins.</li>
<li>working developers are starting to realize that Maven not only simplifies the task of build management, it is helping to encourage a common interface between developers and software projects.</li>

<h1 id="Maven-vs-Ant"><a href="#Maven-vs-Ant" class="headerlink" title="Maven vs Ant"></a>Maven vs Ant</h1><h2 id="The-differences-between-Ant-and-Maven-in-this-example-are"><a href="#The-differences-between-Ant-and-Maven-in-this-example-are" class="headerlink" title="The differences between Ant and Maven in this example are:"></a>The differences between Ant and Maven in this example are:</h2><h3 id="Apache-Ant"><a href="#Apache-Ant" class="headerlink" title="Apache Ant"></a>Apache Ant</h3><p>Ant doesn’t have formal conventions such as a common project directory structure; you have to tell Ant exactly where to find the source and where to put the output. Informal conventions have emerged over time, but they haven’t been codified into the product.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ant is procedural; you have to tell Ant exactly what to do and when to do it. You have to tell it to compile, then copy, then compress.</li>
<li>Ant doesn’t have a lifecycle; you have to define goals and goal dependencies. You have to attach a sequence of tasks to each goal manually.<h3 id="Apache-Maven"><a href="#Apache-Maven" class="headerlink" title="Apache Maven"></a>Apache Maven</h3></li>
<li>Maven has conventions: in the example, it already knew where your source code was because you followed the convention. It put the bytecode in target/classes, and it produced a JAR file in target.</li>
<li>Maven is declarative; all you had to do was create a pom.xml file and put your source in the default directory. Maven took care of the rest.</li>
<li>Maven has a lifecycle, which you invoked when you executed mvn install. This command told Maven to execute a series of sequence steps until it reached the lifecycle. As a side effect of this journey through the lifecycle, Maven executed a number of default plugin goals that did things such as compile and create a JAR.</li>
<li>A Maven plugin is a collection of one or more goals (see Figure 3-1). Examples of Maven plugins can be simple core plugins such as the Jar plugin that contains goals for creating JAR files, the Compiler plugin that contains goals for compiling source code and unit tests, or the Surefire plugin that contains goals for executing unit tests and generating reports.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Maven-life-cycle"><a href="#Maven-life-cycle" class="headerlink" title="Maven life cycle"></a>Maven life cycle</h4><ul>
<li>The second command we ran in the previous section was <strong>mvn install</strong>. This command didn’t specify a plugin goal; instead, it specified a Maven lifecycle phase. A phase is a step in what Maven calls the “build lifecycle.” The build lifecycle is an ordered sequence of phases involved in building a project.</li>
<li><strong>Plugin goals can be attached to a lifecycle phase</strong>. As Maven moves through the phases in a lifecycle, it will execute the goals attached to each particular phase. Each phase may have zero or more goals bound to it. In the previous section, when you ran mvn install, you might have noticed that more than one goal was executed. Examine the output after running mvn install and take note of the various goals that are executed. </li>
<li>Maven steps through the phases preceding package in the Maven lifecycle; <strong>executing a phase will first execute all proceeding phases in order</strong>, ending with the phase specified on the command line. Each phase corresponds to zero or more goals, and since we haven’t performed any plugin configuration or customization, this example binds a set of standard plugin goals to the default lifecycle. </li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Dependency"><a href="#Dependency" class="headerlink" title="Dependency"></a>Dependency</h1><ul>
<li>“Maven provides <strong>declarative dependency management</strong>. With this approach, you declare your project’s dependencies in an external file called pom.xml. Maven will automatically download those dependencies and hand them over to your project for the purpose of building, testing, or packaging.”</li>
<li>“The default remote repository with which Maven interacts is called Maven Central, and it is located at repo.maven.apache.org and uk.maven.org.”</li>
<li>“The <strong>internal repository manager</strong> acts as a proxy to remote repositories. Because you have full control over the internal repository, you can regulate the types of artifacts allowed in your company. Additionally, you can also push your organization’s artifacts onto the server, thereby enabling collaboration. ”, such as Nexus</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Transitive-Dependcies"><a href="#Transitive-Dependcies" class="headerlink" title="Transitive Dependcies"></a>Transitive Dependcies</h2><ul>
<li>“A key benefit of Maven is that it automatically “deals with transitive dependencies and includes them in your project.</li>
<li>“Maven uses a technique known as <strong>dependency mediation</strong> to resolve version conflicts. Simply stated, dependency mediation allows Maven to pull the dependency that <strong>is closest to the project in the tree</strong>. In Figure 3-3, there are two versions of dependency B: 0.0.8 and 1.0.0. In this scenario, version 0.0.8 of dependency B is included in the project, because it is a direct dependency and closest to the tree. Now look at the three versions of dependency F: 0.1.3, 1.0.0, and 2.2.0. All three dependencies are at the same depth. In this scenario, Maven will use the <strong>first-found dependency</strong>, which would be 0.1.3, and not the latest 2.2.0 version.”</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Dependency-Scope"><a href="#Dependency-Scope" class="headerlink" title="Dependency Scope"></a>Dependency Scope</h2><ul>
<li>“Maven uses the concept of scope, which allows you to specify <strong>when and where</strong> you need a particular dependency.” “Maven provides the following six scopes:”</li>
<li>“<strong>compile</strong>: Dependencies with the compile scope are available in the class path in all phases on a project build, test, and run. This is the default scope.”</li>
<li>“<strong>provided</strong>: Dependencies with the provided scope are available in the class path during the build and test phases. They don’t get bundled within the generated artifact. Examples of dependencies that use this scope include Servlet api, JSP api, and so on.”</li>
<li>“<strong>runtime</strong>: Dependencies with the runtime scope are not available in the class path during the build phase. Instead they get bundled in the generated artifact and are available during runtime.”</li>
<li>“<strong>test</strong>: Dependencies with the test scope are available during the test phase. JUnit and TestNG are good examples of dependencies with the test scope.”</li>
<li>“<strong>system</strong>: Dependencies with the system scope are similar to dependencies with the provided scope, except that these dependencies are not retrieved from the repository. Instead, a hard-coded path to the file system is specified from which the dependencies are used.”</li>
<li>“<strong>import</strong>: The import scope is applicable for .pom file dependencies only. It allows you to include dependency management information from a remote .pom file. The import scope is available only in Maven 2.0.9 or later.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Maven is better for managing dependencies (but Ant is ok with them too, if you use Ant+Ivy) and build artefacts. The main benefit from maven - its lifecycle. You can just add specific actions on correct phase, which seems pretty logical: just launch you integration tests on integration-test phase for example. Also, there are many existing plugins, which can could almost everything. Maven archetype is powerful feature, which allows you to quickly create project.</p>
<p>Ant is better for controlling of build process. Before your very first build you have to write you build.xml. If your build process is very specific, you have to create complicated scripts. For long-term projects support of ant-scripts could become really painful: scripts become too complicated, people, who has written them, could leave project, etc.</p>
<p>Both of them use xml, which could become too big in big long-term projects.</p>
<p>Anyway, you shoud read specific documentation (not hate-articles) on both. Also, there is ant-maven-plugin, which allow to launch ant-scripts with maven.</p>
<p>P.S. You can take a look on Gradle, which for me could provide more freedom than Maven, but is easier to use than Ant.</p>

            <h1 id="This-is-the-second-half-about-Java-Concurrent-of-my-blog"><a href="#This-is-the-second-half-about-Java-Concurrent-of-my-blog" class="headerlink" title="This is the second half about Java Concurrent of my blog"></a>This is the second half about Java Concurrent of my blog</h1><h2 id="non-blocking-synchronization"><a href="#non-blocking-synchronization" class="headerlink" title="non-blocking synchronization"></a>non-blocking synchronization</h2><ul>
<li>Much of the recent research on concurrent algorithms has focused on nonblock- ing algorithms, which use low-level atomic machine instructions such as compare- and-swap instead of locks to ensure data integrity under concurrent access. Non- blocking algorithms are used extensively in operating systems and JVMs for thread and process scheduling, garbage collection, and to implement locks and other concurrent data structures.</li>
<li>Nonblocking algorithms are considerably more complicated to design and im- plement than lock-based alternatives, but they can <strong>offer significant scalability and liveness advantages</strong>. They coordinate at a finer level of granularity and can greatly reduce scheduling overhead because they don’t block when multiple threads contend for the same data. Further, they are <code>immune to deadlock and other liveness problems</code>. In lock-based algorithms, other threads cannot make progress if a thread goes to sleep or spins while holding a lock, whereas <code>nonblocking algorithms are impervious to individual thread failures</code>. As of Java 5.0, it is possible to build efficient <strong>nonblocking algorithms in Java using the atomic variable classes such as AtomicInteger and AtomicReference</strong>.</li>
<li>Atomic variables can also be used as <strong>“better volatile variables”</strong> even if you are not developing nonblocking algorithms. <code>Atomic variables offer the same memory semantics as volatile variables</code>, but with additional support for atomic updates— making them ideal for counters, sequence generators, and statistics gathering while offering better scalability than lock-based alternatives.</li>
<li>Coordinating access to shared state using a consistent locking protocol ensures that whichever thread holds the lock guarding a set of variables has exclusive access to those variables, and that any changes made to those variables are visible to other threads that subsequently acquire the lock.</li>
<li><code>Volatile variables are a lighter-weight synchronization mechanism</code> than locking <code>because they do not involve context switches or thread scheduling</code>. However, volatile variables have some limitations compared to locking: while they provide similar visibility guarantees, they <code>cannot be used to construct atomic compound actions</code>. This means that volatile variables cannot be used when one variable de- pends on another, or when the new value of a variable depends on its old value. This limits when volatile variables are appropriate, since they cannot be used to reliably implement common tools such as counters or mutexes.</li>
<li>This can be a serious problem <strong>if the blocked thread is a high-priority thread but the thread holding the lock is a lower-priority thread—a performance hazard known as priority inversion</strong>. Even though the higher-priority thread should have precedence, it must wait until the lock is released, and this effectively down- grades its priority to that of the lower-priority thread. If a thread holding a lock is permanently blocked (due to an infinite loop, deadlock, livelock, or other liveness failure), any threads waiting for that lock can never make progress.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="hardware"><a href="#hardware" class="headerlink" title="hardware"></a>hardware</h1><ul>
<li><code>Exclusive locking is a pessimistic technique</code>—it assumes the worst (if you don’t lock your door, gremlins will come in and rearrange your stuff) and doesn’t proceed until you can guarantee, by acquiring the appropriate locks, that other threads will not interfere.</li>
<li>For fine-grained operations, there is an alternate approach that is often more efficient—<code>the optimistic approach</code>, whereby you proceed with an update, hopeful that you can complete it without interference. <code>This approach relies on collision detection to determine if there has been interference from other parties during the update</code>, in which case the operation fails and can be retried (or not). The optimistic approach is like the old saying, <code>“It is easier to obtain forgiveness than permission”</code>, where “easier” here means “more efficient”.</li>
<li>Processors designed for multiprocessor operation provide special instructions for managing concurrent access to shared variables. Early processors had atomic <strong>test-and-set, fetch-and-increment, or swap</strong> instructions sufficient for implementing mutexes that could in turn be used to implement more sophisticated concurrent objects. Today, nearly every modern processor has some form of atomic read- modify-write instruction, such as <strong>compare-and-swap or load-linked/store-conditional</strong>. Operating systems and JVMs use these instructions to implement locks and con- current data structures, but until Java 5.0 they had not been available directly to Java classes.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Compare-and-swap"><a href="#Compare-and-swap" class="headerlink" title="Compare and swap"></a>Compare and swap</h1><ul>
<li>The approach taken by most processor architectures, including IA32 and Sparc, is to implement a <strong>compare-and-swap (CAS)</strong> instruction. (Other processors, such as PowerPC, implement the same functionality with a pair of instructions: load- linked and store-conditional.) <code>CAS has three operands—a memory location V on which to operate, the expected old value A, and the new value B. CAS atomically updates V to the new value B, but only if the value in V matches the expected old value A; otherwise it does nothing</code>. In either case, it returns the value currently in V. (The <code>variant called compare-and-set instead returns whether the operation succeeded</code>.) <strong>CAS means “I think V should have the value A; if it does, put B there, otherwise don’t change it but tell me I was wrong.” CAS is an optimistic technique</strong>—<code>it proceeds with the update in the hope of success</code>, and can detect failure if another thread has updated the variable since it was last examined. SimulatedCAS in Listing 15.1 illustrates the semantics (but not the implementation or performance) of CAS.</li>
<li><code>When multiple threads attempt to update the same variable simultaneously using CAS, one wins and updates the variable’s value, and the rest lose</code>. But the losers are not punished by suspension, as they could be if they failed to acquire a lock; instead, they are told that they didn’t win the race this time but can try again. Because a thread that loses a CAS is not blocked, it can decide whether it wants to try again, take some other recovery action, or do nothing.3 This flexibility eliminates many of the liveness hazards associated with locking (though in unusual cases can introduce the risk of livelock—see Section 10.3.3).</li>
<li>CAS addresses the problem of <strong>implementing atomic read-modify-write sequences without locking</strong>, <code>because it can detect interference from other threads</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="counter-implemented-by-CAS"><a href="#counter-implemented-by-CAS" class="headerlink" title="counter implemented by CAS"></a>counter implemented by CAS</h2><ul>
<li>At first glance, the CAS-based counter looks as if it should perform worse than a lock-based counter; it has more operations and a more complicated control flow, and depends on the seemingly complicated CAS operation. But in reality, CAS-based counters significantly outperform lock-based counters if there is even a small amount of contention, and often even if there is no contention. The fast path for uncontended lock acquisition typically requires at least one CAS plus other lock-related housekeeping, so more work is going on in the best case for a lock-based counter than in the normal case for the CAS-based counter. Since the CAS succeeds most of the time (assuming low to moderate contention), the hardware will correctly predict the branch implicit in the while loop, minimizing the overhead of the more complicated control logic.</li>
<li>The language syntax for locking may be compact, but the work done by the JVM and OS to manage locks is not. Locking entails traversing a relatively com- plicated code path in the JVM and may entail OS-level locking, thread suspension, and context switches. In the best case, locking requires at least one CAS, so using locks moves the CAS out of sight but doesn’t save any actual execution cost. On the other hand, executing a CAS from within the program involves no JVM code, system calls, or scheduling activity. What looks like a longer code path at the ap- plication level is in fact a much shorter code path when JVM and OS activity are taken into account. <code>The primary disadvantage of CAS is that it forces the caller to deal with contention (by retrying, backing off, or giving up), whereas locks deal with contention automatically by blocking until the lock is available</code>.</li>
<li>Competitive forces will likely result in continued CAS performance improvement over the next sev- eral years. A good rule of thumb is that the <strong>cost of the “fast path” for uncontended lock acquisition and release on most processors is approximately twice the cost of a CAS</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="CAS-support-in-JVM"><a href="#CAS-support-in-JVM" class="headerlink" title="CAS support in JVM"></a>CAS support in JVM</h2><ul>
<li>So, how does Java code convince the processor to execute a CAS on its behalf? Prior to Java 5.0, there was no way to do this short of writing native code. <code>In Java 5.0, low-level support was added to expose CAS operations on int, long, and object references</code>, and the <code>JVM compiles these into the most efficient means provided by the underlying hardware</code>. On platforms supporting CAS, the run- time inlines them into the appropriate machine instruction(s); <code>in the worst case, if a CAS-like instruction is not available the JVM uses a spin lock</code>. This low-level JVM support is used by the atomic variable classes (AtomicXxx in java.util.con- current.atomic) to provide an efficient CAS operation on numeric and reference types; these atomic variable classes are used, directly or indirectly, to implement most of the classes in java.util.concurrent.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Other-liveness-hazards"><a href="#Other-liveness-hazards" class="headerlink" title="Other liveness hazards"></a>Other liveness hazards</h1><ul>
<li>While deadlock is the most widely encountered liveness hazard, there are sev- eral other liveness hazards you may encounter in concurrent programs including starvation, missed signals, and livelock.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Starvation"><a href="#Starvation" class="headerlink" title="Starvation"></a>Starvation</h2><ul>
<li>Starvation occurs when a thread is perpetually denied access to resources it needs in order to make progress; the most commonly starved resource is CPU cycles. Starvation in Java applications can be caused by inappropriate use of thread prior- ities. It can also be caused by executing nonterminating constructs (infinite loops or resource waits that do not terminate) with a lock held, since other threads that need that lock will never be able to acquire it.</li>
<li>The thread priorities defined in the Thread API are merely scheduling hints. The Thread API defines ten priority levels that the JVM can map to operating system scheduling priorities as it sees fit. This mapping is platform-specific, so two Java priorities can map to the same OS priority on one system and different OS priorities on another.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid the temptation to use thread priorities, since they increase platform dependence and can cause liveness problems</strong>. Most concurrent applica- tions can use the default priority for all threads.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Poor-responsiveness"><a href="#Poor-responsiveness" class="headerlink" title="Poor responsiveness"></a>Poor responsiveness</h2><ul>
<li>One step removed from starvation is poor responsiveness, which is not uncom- mon in GUI applications using background threads.</li>
<li>If the work done by other threads are truly background tasks, lowering their priority can make the foreground tasks more responsive.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Livelock"><a href="#Livelock" class="headerlink" title="Livelock"></a>Livelock</h2><ul>
<li><strong>Livelock is a form of liveness failure</strong> in which a thread, while <strong>not blocked</strong>, still <strong>cannot make progress</strong> because it keeps retrying an operation that <strong>will always fail</strong>. </li>
<li>Livelock often occurs in transactional messaging applications, where the messaging infrastructure rolls back a transaction if a message cannot be processed successfully, and puts it back at the head of the queue. If a bug in the message handler for a particular type of message causes it to fail, <strong>every time the message is dequeued and passed to the buggy handler, the transaction is rolled back</strong>. Since the message is now back at the head of the queue, the <strong>handler is called over and over with the same result</strong>. (This is sometimes called the <strong>poison message</strong> problem.) The <strong>message handling thread is not blocked, but it will never make progress either</strong>. This form of livelock often comes from <strong>overeager error-recovery code that mistakenly treats an unrecoverable error as a recoverable one</strong>.</li>
<li>This is similar to what happens when <strong>two overly polite people</strong> are walking in opposite directions in a hallway: each steps out of the other’s way, and now they are again in each other’s way. So they both step aside again, and again, and again. . .</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Solutions"><a href="#Solutions" class="headerlink" title="Solutions"></a>Solutions</h3><ul>
<li>The solution for this variety of livelock is <strong>to introduce some randomness into the retry mechanism</strong>. For example, when two stations in an ethernet network try to send a packet on the shared carrier at the same time, the packets collide. The stations detect the collision, and each tries to send their packet again later. If they each retry exactly one second later, they collide over and over, and neither packet ever goes out, even if there is plenty of available bandwidth. To avoid this, we make each wait an amount of time that includes a random component. (The ethernet protocol also includes exponential backoff after repeated collisions, reducing both congestion and the risk of repeated failure with multiple colliding stations.) Retrying with random waits and backoffs can be equally effective for avoiding livelock in concurrent applications.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h3><ul>
<li>Liveness failures are a serious problem because there is no way to recover from them short of aborting the application. The most common form of liveness failure is lock-ordering deadlock. Avoiding lock ordering deadlock starts at design time: ensure that when threads acquire multiple locks, they do so in a consistent order. The best way to do this is by using open calls throughout your program. This greatly reduces the number of places where multiple locks are held at once, and makes it more obvious where those places are.<h1 id="Reference"><a href="#Reference" class="headerlink" title="Reference"></a>Reference</h1></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Performance"><a href="#Performance" class="headerlink" title="Performance"></a>Performance</h1><ul>
<li>One of the primary reasons to use threads is to improve performance.</li>
<li>First make your program right, then make it fast—and then only if your performance requirements and measurements tell you it needs to be faster. In designing a con- current application, squeezing out the last bit of performance is often the least of your concerns.</li>
<li>When the performance of an activity is limited by availability of a par- ticular resource, we say it is bound by that resource: CPU-bound, database-bound, etc.</li>
<li>using multiple threads always introduces some performance costs compared to the single-threaded approach. These include the overhead associated with coordinating between threads (locking, signaling, and memory synchronization), increased context switching,thread creation and teardown, and scheduling overhead. When threading is employed effectively, these costs are more than made up for by greater throughput, responsiveness, or capacity. On the other hand, a poorly designed concurrent application can perform even worse than a comparable sequential one.</li>
<li>we want to keep the CPUs busy with <strong>useful</strong> work</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Scalability"><a href="#Scalability" class="headerlink" title="Scalability"></a>Scalability</h2><ul>
<li>Scalability describes the ability to improve throughput or capacity when additional computing resources (such as additional CPUs, memory, stor- age, or I/O bandwidth) are added.</li>
<li>Nearly all engineering decisions involve some form of tradeoff. </li>
<li>This is one of the reasons why most optimizations are premature: <strong>they are often undertaken before a clear set of requirements is available</strong>.</li>
<li>Avoid premature optimization. <strong>First make it right, then make it fast</strong>—if it is not already fast enough.</li>
<li>Measure, don’t guess.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Amdahl’s-law"><a href="#Amdahl’s-law" class="headerlink" title="Amdahl’s law"></a>Amdahl’s law</h3><ul>
<li>the theoretical speedup is always limited by the part of the task that cannot benefit from the improvement.</li>
<li>If F is the fraction of the calculation that must be executed serially, then Amdahl’s law says that on a machine with N processors, we can achieve a speedup of at most:<br>Speedup ≤ 1 / (F + (1 − F)/N)</li>
<li>As N approaches infinity, the maximum speedup converges to 1/F, meaning that <strong>a program in which fifty percent of the processing must be executed serially can be sped up only by a factor of two</strong>, regardless of how many processors are available, and a program in which ten percent must be executed serially can be sped up by at most a factor of ten. </li>
<li>Amdahl’s law also quantifies the efficiency cost of serialization. With ten processors, a program with 10% serialization can achieve at most a speedup of 5.3 (at 53% utilization), and with 100 processors it can achieve at most a speedup of 9.2 (at 9% utilization). It takes a lot of inefficiently utilized CPUs to never get to that factor of ten.</li>
<li>It is clear that as processor counts increase, even a small percentage of serialized execution limits how much throughput can be increased with additional computing resources.</li>
<li>All concurrent applications have some sources of serialization; if you think yours does not, look again.</li>
<li>Amdahl’s law tells us that the scalability of an application is driven by the proportion of code that must be executed serially. Since the primary source of serialization in Java programs is the exclusive resource lock, scalability can often be improved by spending less time holding locks, either by reducing lock granu- larity, reducing the duration for which locks are held, or replacing exclusive locks with nonexclusive or nonblocking alternatives.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Costs-introduced-by-threads"><a href="#Costs-introduced-by-threads" class="headerlink" title="Costs introduced by threads"></a>Costs introduced by threads</h1><h2 id="Context-switching"><a href="#Context-switching" class="headerlink" title="Context switching"></a>Context switching</h2><ul>
<li>Context switches are not free; thread scheduling requires manipulating shared data structures in the OS and JVM. The OS and JVM use the same CPUs your pro- gram does; more CPU time spent in JVM and OS code means less is available for your program.</li>
<li>When a new thread is switched in, the data it needs is unlikely to be in the local processor cache, so a context switch causes a flurry of cache misses, and thus threads run a little more slowly when they are first scheduled.</li>
<li>The actual cost of context switching varies across platforms, but a good rule of thumb is that a <strong>context switch costs the equivalent of 5,000 to 10,000 clock cycles</strong>, or several microseconds on most current processors.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="memory-synchronization"><a href="#memory-synchronization" class="headerlink" title="memory synchronization"></a>memory synchronization</h2><ul>
<li>The performance cost of synchronization comes from several sources. The visibility guarantees provided by synchronized and volatile may entail using <strong>special instructions called memory barriers</strong> that can flush or invalidate caches, flush hard- ware write buffers, and stall execution pipelines. <strong>Memory barriers</strong> may also have indirect performance consequences because they <strong>inhibit other compiler optimizations</strong>; most operations cannot be reordered with memory barriers.</li>
<li>When assessing the performance impact of synchronization, it is <strong>important to distinguish between contended and uncontended synchronization</strong>. The synchronized mechanism is optimized for the uncontended case (<strong>volatile is always uncontended</strong>), and at this writing, the performance cost of <strong>a “fast-path” uncontended synchronization ranges from 20 to 250 clock cycles</strong> for most systems. While this is certainly not zero, the effect of needed, uncontended synchronization is rarely significant in overall application performance, and the alternative involves compromising safety and potentially signing yourself (or your succes- sor) up for some very painful bug hunting later.</li>
<li>Modern <strong>JVMs can reduce the cost of incidental synchronization</strong> by optimizing away locking that can be proven never to contend. If a lock object is accessible only to the current thread, the JVM is permitted to optimize away a lock acquisi- tion because there is no way another thread could synchronize on the same lock. For example, the lock acquisition in following Listing can always be eliminated by the JVM.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following synchronization has no effect</p>
<figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">synchronized</span> (<span class="keyword">new</span> Object()) &#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">// do something</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<ul>
<li><p>More sophisticated JVMs can use <strong>escape analysis</strong> to identify when a local object reference is never published to the heap and is therefore thread-local. As below sample:</p>
<figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> String <span class="title">getStoogeNames</span><span class="params">()</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">List&lt;String&gt; stooges = <span class="keyword">new</span> Vector&lt;String&gt;(); stooges.add(<span class="string">"Moe"</span>);</span><br><span class="line">stooges.add(<span class="string">"Larry"</span>);</span><br><span class="line">stooges.add(<span class="string">"Curly"</span>);</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">return</span> stooges.toString();</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
</li>
<li><p>the only reference to the List is the local variable stooges, and <strong>stack-confined variables are automatically thread-local</strong>. A naive execution of getStoogeNames would acquire and release the lock on the Vector four times, once for each call to add or toString. However, a smart runtime compiler can inline these calls and then see <strong>that stooges and its internal state never escape</strong>, and therefore that <strong>all four lock acquisitions can be eliminated</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Even without escape analysis, compilers can also perform <strong>lock coarsening</strong>, the <strong>merging of adjacent synchronized blocks using the same lock</strong>. For getStooge- Names, a JVM that performs lock coarsening might combine the three calls to add and the call to toString into a single lock acquisition and release, using heuristics on the relative cost of synchronization versus the instructions inside the synch- ronized block.5 Not only does this reduce the synchronization overhead, but it also gives the optimizer a much larger block to work with, likely enabling other optimizations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Don’t worry excessively about the cost of uncontended synchronization. The basic mechanism is already quite fast, and JVMs can perform addi- tional optimizations that further reduce or eliminate the cost. Instead, focus optimization efforts on areas where lock contention actually occurs.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Synchronization by one thread can also affect the performance of other threads. Synchronization creates traffic on the shared memory bus; this bus has a limited bandwidth and is shared across all processors. If threads must compete for synchronization bandwidth, all threads using synchronization will suffer.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Blocking"><a href="#Blocking" class="headerlink" title="Blocking"></a>Blocking</h2><ul>
<li><strong>Uncontended synchronization</strong> can be handled <strong>entirely within the JVM</strong> (Bacon et al., 1998); <strong>contended synchronization may require OS activity</strong>, which adds to the cost. When locking is contended, the losing thread(s) must block. The JVM can implement blocking either via spin-waiting (repeatedly trying to acquire the lock until it succeeds) or by suspending the blocked thread through the operating system. Which is more efficient depends on the relationship between context switch overhead and the time until the lock becomes available; spin-waiting is preferable for short waits and suspension is preferable for long waits. Some JVMs choose between the two adaptively based on profiling data of past wait times, but most just suspend threads waiting for a lock.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Reducing-lock-contention"><a href="#Reducing-lock-contention" class="headerlink" title="Reducing lock contention"></a>Reducing lock contention</h2><ul>
<li>We’ve seen that <strong>serialization hurts scalability</strong> and that <strong>context switches hurt performance</strong>. <strong>Contended locking causes both</strong>, so <strong>reducing lock contention can improve both performance and scalability</strong>.
Access to resources guarded by an exclusive lock is serialized—only one thread at a time may access it. Of course, we use locks for good reasons, such as preventing data corruption, but this safety comes at a price. Persistent contention for a lock limits scalability.</li>
<li>The principal threat to scalability in concurrent applications is the exclu- sive resource lock.</li>
<li>Two factors influence the likelihood of contention for a lock: how often that lock is requested and how long it is held once acquired.7 If the product of these factors is sufficiently small, then most attempts to acquire the lock will be uncon- tended, and lock contention will not pose a significant scalability impediment.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="There-are-three-ways-to-reduce-lock-contention"><a href="#There-are-three-ways-to-reduce-lock-contention" class="headerlink" title="There are three ways to reduce lock contention:"></a>There are three ways to reduce lock contention:</h3><ul>
<li>Reduce the duration for which locks are held;</li>
<li>Reduce the frequency with which locks are requested; or</li>
<li>Replace exclusive locks with coordination mechanisms that permit<br>greater concurrency.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Narrowing-lock-scope"><a href="#Narrowing-lock-scope" class="headerlink" title="Narrowing lock scope"></a>Narrowing lock scope</h2><ul>
<li><strong>An effective way to reduce the likelihood of contention is to hold locks as briefly as possible</strong>. This can be done by moving code that doesn’t require the lock out of synchronized blocks, especially for expensive operations and potentially block- ing operations such as I/O.</li>
<li>It is easy to see how holding a “hot” lock for too long can limit scalability</li>
<li>Reducing the scope of the lock in userLocationMatches substantially reduces the number of instructions that are executed with the lock held. <strong>By Amdahl’s law, this removes an impediment to scalability because the amount of serialized code is reduced</strong>.</li>
<li>Because AttributeStore has only one state variable, attributes, we can im- prove it further by the technique of <strong>delegating thread safety</strong> (Section 4.3). By replacing attributes with a thread-safe Map (a Hashtable, synchronizedMap, or Con- currentHashMap), AttributeStore can delegate all its thread safety obligations to the underlying thread-safe collection.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Reducing-lock-granularity"><a href="#Reducing-lock-granularity" class="headerlink" title="Reducing lock granularity"></a>Reducing lock granularity</h2><ul>
<li>The other way to reduce the fraction of time that a lock is held (and therefore the likelihood that it will be contended) is to <strong>have threads ask for it less often</strong>. This can be accomplished <strong>by lock splitting and lock striping</strong>, which involve <strong>using separate locks to guard multiple independent state variables previously guarded by a single lock</strong>. These techniques reduce the granularity at which locking occurs, potentially allowing greater scalability—but using more locks also increases the risk of deadlock.</li>
<li>If a lock guards more than one <strong>independent</strong> state variable, you may be able to improve scalability by splitting it into multiple locks that each guard different variables. This results in each lock being requested less often.</li>
<li>After splitting the lock, each new finer-grained lock will see less locking traffic than the original coarser lock would have.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Lock-stripping"><a href="#Lock-stripping" class="headerlink" title="Lock stripping"></a>Lock stripping</h2><ul>
<li>Splitting a heavily contended lock into two is likely to result in two heavily contended locks. </li>
<li>Lock splitting can sometimes be extended to partition locking on a variable- sized set of independent objects, in which case it is called lock striping. For exam- ple, the implementation of ConcurrentHashMap uses an array of 16 locks, each of which guards 1/16 of the hash buckets; bucket N is guarded by lock N mod 16.</li>
<li>One of the downsides of lock striping is that locking the collection for ex- clusive access is more difficult and costly than with a single lock. Usually <strong>an operation can be performed by acquiring at most one lock</strong>, but <strong>occasionally you need to lock the entire collection</strong>, as when ConcurrentHashMap needs <strong>to expand the map and rehash the values</strong> into a larger set of buckets. This is typically done by acquiring all of the locks in the stripe set</li>
<li>common optimizations such as caching frequently computed values can introduce “hot fields” that limit scalability.</li>
<li>A common optimization is to update a separate counter as entries are added or removed; this slightly increases the cost of a put or remove operation to keep the counter up-to-date, but reduces the cost of the size operation from O(n) to O(1).</li>
<li>In this case, the counter is called a <strong>hot field</strong> because every mutative operation needs to access it.</li>
<li>ConcurrentHashMap avoids this problem by having size enumerate the stripes and add up the number of elements in each stripe, instead of maintaining a global count. To avoid enumerating every element, ConcurrentHashMap maintains a separate count field for each stripe, also guarded by the stripe lock.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Alternative-to-exclusive-lock"><a href="#Alternative-to-exclusive-lock" class="headerlink" title="Alternative to exclusive lock"></a>Alternative to exclusive lock</h2><ul>
<li>A third technique for mitigating the effect of lock contention <strong>is to forego the use of exclusive locks</strong> in favor of a more concurrency-friendly means of managing shared state. These include <strong>using the concurrent collections, read-write locks, immutable objects and atomic variables</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ReadWriteLock"><a href="#ReadWriteLock" class="headerlink" title="ReadWriteLock"></a>ReadWriteLock</h3><ul>
<li>enforces a <strong>multiple-reader, single-writer</strong> locking discipline: more than one reader can access the shared resource concurrently so long as none of them wants to modify it, but writers must acquire the lock excusively. For read-mostly data structures, ReadWriteLock can offer greater concurrency than exclusive locking; <strong>for read-only data structures, immutability can eliminate the need for locking entirely</strong>.</li>
<li>Atomic variables (see Chapter 15) offer a means of reducing the cost of updat- ing “hot fields” such as statistics counters, sequence generators, or the reference</li>
<li>If size is called frequently compared to mutative operations, striped data structures can optimize for this by caching the collection size in a volatile whenever size is called and invalidating the cache (setting it to -1) whenever the collection is modified. If the cached value is nonnegative on entry to size, it is accurate and can be returned; otherwise it is recomputed.</li>
<li>The atomic variable classes pro- vide very fine-grained (and therefore more scalable) atomic operations on integers or object references, and are implemented using low-level concurrency primitives (such as compare-and-swap) provided by most modern processors. If your class has a small number of hot fields that do not participate in invariants with other variables, replacing them with atomic variables may improve scalability.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Comparing-Map"><a href="#Comparing-Map" class="headerlink" title="Comparing Map"></a>Comparing Map</h1><ul>
<li>The single-threaded performance of ConcurrentHashMap is slightly better than that of a synchronized HashMap, but it is in concurrent use that it really shines. The implementation of ConcurrentHashMap assumes the most common operation is retrieving a value that already exists, and is therefore optimized to <strong>provide highest performance and concurrency for successful get operations</strong>.</li>
<li>The major scalability impediment for the synchronized Map implementations is that there is a single lock for the entire map, so only one thread can access the map at a time. On the other hand, ConcurrentHashMap does no locking for most successful read operations, and <strong>uses lock striping for write operations</strong> and those few read operations that do require locking. As a result, multiple threads can access the Map concurrently without blocking.</li>
<li>The numbers for the synchronized collections are not as encouraging. Perfor- mance for the one-thread case is comparable to ConcurrentHashMap, but once the load transitions from mostly uncontended to mostly contended—which happens here at two threads—the synchronized collections suffer badly. This is common behavior for code whose scalability is limited by lock contention. So long as contention is low, time per operation is dominated by the time to actually do the work and throughput may improve as threads are added. Once contention becomes significant, time per operation is dominated by context switch and scheduling delays, and adding more threads has little effect on throughput.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Building-a-asynchronous-log"><a href="#Building-a-asynchronous-log" class="headerlink" title="Building a asynchronous log"></a>Building a asynchronous log</h1><ul>
<li>Building a logger that moves the I/O to another thread may improve performance, but it also introduces a number of design complications, such as interruption (what happens if a thread blocked in a logging operation is interrupted?), service guarantees (does the logger guarantee that a success- fully queued log message will be logged prior to service shutdown?), saturation policy (what happens when the producers log messages faster than the logger thread can handle them?), and service lifecycle (how do we shut down the logger, and how do we communicate the service state to producers?).</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Reducing-context-switching"><a href="#Reducing-context-switching" class="headerlink" title="Reducing context switching"></a>Reducing context switching</h1><ul>
<li>The “get in, get out” principle of Section 11.4.1 tells us that <strong>we should hold locks as briefly as possible</strong>, because <strong>the longer a lock is held, the more likely that lock will be contended</strong>. If a thread blocks waiting for I/O while holding a lock, another thread is more likely to want the lock while the first thread is holding it. Concurrent systems perform much better when most lock acquisitions are uncontended, because contended lock acquisition means more context switches. A coding style that encourages more context switches thus yields lower overall throughput.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Testing-concurrency"><a href="#Testing-concurrency" class="headerlink" title="Testing concurrency"></a>Testing concurrency</h1><ul>
<li>we defined safety as “nothing bad ever happens” and liveness as “something good eventually happens”.</li>
<li>when interrupted, it throws InterruptedException. This is one of the few cases in which it is appropriate to subclass Thread explicitly instead of using a Runnable in a pool: in order to test proper termination with join.</li>
<li>The result of <strong>Thread.getState should not be used</strong> for concurrency control, and is of limited usefulness for testing—its primary utility is as a source of debugging information.</li>
<li>a common error in implementing semaphore-controlled buffers is to forget that the code actually doing the insertion and extraction requires mutual exclu- sion (using synchronized or ReentrantLock). A sample run of PutTakeTest with a version of BoundedBuffer that omits making doInsert and doExtract synch- ronized fails fairly quickly. </li>
<li><strong>Tests should be run on multiprocessor systems to increase the diversity of potential interleavings. However, having more than a few CPUs does not necessarily make tests more effective. To maximize the chance of detecting timing-sensitive data races, there should be more active threads than CPUs, so that at any given time some threads are running and some are switched out, thus reducing the predicatability of interactions between threads</strong>.</li>
<li>Tests like PutTakeTest tend to be good at finding safety violations. For exam- ple, a common error in implementing semaphore-controlled buffers is to forget that the code actually doing the insertion and extraction requires mutual exclu- sion (using synchronized or ReentrantLock). A sample run of PutTakeTest with a version of BoundedBuffer that omits making doInsert and doExtract synch- ronized fails fairly quickly. Running PutTakeTest with a few dozen threads iterating a few million times on buffers of various capacity on various systems increases our confidence about the lack of data corruption in put and take.</li>
<li>The source code <strong>PutTakeTest.java</strong> demonstreated aforesaid logic.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Test-resource-management"><a href="#Test-resource-management" class="headerlink" title="Test resource management"></a>Test resource management</h2><ul>
<li><strong>The tests so far have been concerned with a class’s adherence to its specifica- tion—that it does what it is supposed to do. A secondary aspect to test is that it does not do things it is not supposed to do</strong>, such as leak resources. Any object that holds or manages other objects should not continue to maintain references to those objects longer than necessary. Such storage leaks prevent garbage collectors from reclaiming memory (or threads, file handles, sockets, database connections, or other limited resources) and can lead to resource exhaustion and application failure.</li>

<li>SS: Secure Shell</li>
<li>An increasing number of our customers are looking to move away from standard FTP for transferring data, so we are often asked which secure FTP protocol we recommend. In the next few paragraphs, we will explain what options are available and their main differences.</li>
<li>The two mainstream protocols available for Secure FTP transfers are named SFTP (FTP over SSH) and FTPS (FTP over SSL). Both SFTP and FTPS offer a high level of protection since they implement strong algorithms such as AES and Triple DES to encrypt any data transferred. Both options also support a wide variety of functionality with a broad command set for transferring and working with files. So the most notable differences between SFTP and FTPS is how connections are authenticated and managed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Authentication-SFTP-vs-FTPS"><a href="#Authentication-SFTP-vs-FTPS" class="headerlink" title="Authentication: SFTP vs. FTPS"></a>Authentication: SFTP vs. FTPS</h2><ul>
<li>With SFTP (FTP over SSH), a connection can be authenticated using a couple different techniques.  For basic authentication, you (or your trading partner) may just require a user id and password to connect to the SFTP server. Its important to note that any user ids and passwords supplied over the SFTP connection will be encrypted, which is a big advantage over standard FTP.</li>
<li>SSH keys can also be used to authenticate SFTP connections in addition to, or instead of, passwords. With key-based authentication, you will first need to generate a SSH private key and public key beforehand. If you need to connect to a trading partner’s SFTP server, you would send your SSH public key to them, which they will load onto their server and associate with your account. When you connect to their SFTP server, your client software will transmit your public key to the server for authentication. If the keys match, along with any user/password supplied, then the authentication will succeed.</li>
<li>With FTPS (FTP over SSL), a connection is authenticated using a user id, password and certificate(s).  Like SFTP, the users and passwords for FTPS connections will also be encrypted. When connecting to a trading partner’s FTPS server, your FTPS client will first check if the server’s certificate is trusted. The certificate is considered trusted if either the certificate was signed off by a known certificate authority (CA), like Verisign, or if the certificate was self-signed (by your partner) and you have a copy of their public certificate in your trusted key store.</li>
<li>Your partner may also require that you supply a certificate when you connect to them.  Your certificate may be signed off by a 3rd party CA or your partner may allow you to just self-sign your certificate, as long as you send them the public portion of your certificate beforehand (which they will load in their trusted key store).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Implementation-SFTP-vs-FTPS"><a href="#Implementation-SFTP-vs-FTPS" class="headerlink" title="Implementation: SFTP vs. FTPS"></a>Implementation: SFTP vs. FTPS</h2><ul>
<li>In regards to how easy each of the secure FTP protocols are to implement, SFTP is the clear winner since it is very firewall friendly. SFTP only needs a single port number (default of 22) to be opened through the firewall.  This port will be used for all SFTP communications, including the initial authentication, any commands issued, as well as any data transferred.</li>
<li>On the other hand, FTPS can be very difficult to patch through a tightly secured firewall since FTPS uses multiple port numbers. The initial port number (default of 21) is used for authentication and passing any commands.  However, every time a file transfer request (get, put) or directory listing request is made, another port number needs to be opened.  You and your trading partners will therefore have to open a range of ports in your firewalls to allow for FTPS connections, which can be a security risk for your network.</li>
</ul>
<p>In summary, SFTP and FTPS are both very secure with strong authentication options.  However since SFTP is much easier to port through firewalls, and we are seeing an increasing percentage of trading partners adopting SFTP, we believe SFTP is the clear winner for your secure FTP needs.</p>
<h1 id="SSH"><a href="#SSH" class="headerlink" title="SSH"></a>SSH</h1><ul>
<li>There are several ways to use SSH; one is to use automatically generated public-private key pairs to simply encrypt a network connection, and then use password authentication to log on.</li>
<li>Another is to use a manually generated public-private key pair to perform the authentication, allowing users or programs to log in without having to specify a password. In this scenario, anyone can produce a matching pair of different keys (public and private). The public key is placed on all computers that must allow access to the owner of the matching private key (the owner keeps the private key secret). While authentication is based on the private key, the key itself is never transferred through the network during authentication. SSH only verifies whether the same person offering the public key also owns the matching private key. In all versions of SSH it is important to verify unknown public keys, i.e. associate the public keys with identities, before accepting them as valid. Accepting an attacker’s public key without validation will authorize an unauthorized attacker as a valid user.</li>
<li>SSH is important in cloud computing to solve connectivity problems, avoiding the security issues of exposing a cloud-based virtual machine directly on the Internet. An SSH tunnel can provide a secure path over the Internet, through a firewall to a virtual machine.</li>
<li>The standard TCP port 22 has been assigned for contacting SSH servers.</li>

<li>ssh-keygen is able to generate a key using one of three different digital signature algorithms.</li>

<li>Subsequently, OpenSSH added support for a third digital signature algorithm, ECDSA </li>
</ul>
<h1 id="DSA"><a href="#DSA" class="headerlink" title="DSA"></a>DSA</h1><ul>
<li>The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) is a Federal Information Processing Standard for digital signatures. It was proposed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in August 1991 for use in their Digital Signature Standard (DSS) and adopted as FIPS 186 in 1993</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Hash"><a href="#Hash" class="headerlink" title="Hash"></a>Hash</h1><p>In cryptography applications, we often need a so-called secure hash function. Secure hash functions are generaelly a subset of hash functions that fulfil at least two extra criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>it must be computationally impossible to reverse the mapping, that is, go from a hash code to a message or piece of data that would have generated that hash code;</li>
<li>it must be infeasible for a collision to occur: that is, for two messages to be found that have the same hash code.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to fulfil these criteria (or at least, as a by-product of needing to fulfil these criteria), secure hash functions generally have these characteristics:</p>
<p>they are slower to compute than the hash codes typically used to key hash maps;<br>they are wider (i.e. have more bits) than weak hash codes.</p>
<p>Secure hash codes are typically 128 bits wide at the very least; compare that, for example, to the 32-bit codes returned by Java hashCode() method, or the 64-bit hash codes recommended for key-less hash maps in Numerical Recipes.</p>
<p>Applications of secure hash functions<br>Secure hash functions actually have various applications. A very common case is verifying the integrity of data. When we send some data, we append a hash of that data; on the receiving end, we re-hash the received data and check that the computed hash equals that sent; if any of the data has changed then (with overwhelming probability), the computed hash value will no longer match the original. Another case is where we need to authenticate some data, i.e. produce a kind of integrity check that only a party with a given private key could produce. (In this case, the general solution is to combine a hash code with encryption.)</p>
<p>In other cases, a secure hash function is useful to represent a particular item of data. For example, for the purpose of checking passwords, we need only store a hash of that password. When somebody enters their password, if the computed hash of what they entered matches the hash stored in the password file/database, we assume they knew the password.</p>
<p>This scheme, sometimes called compare by hash (CBH) can be used to search for duplicates of data on a hard drive or for synching data between multiple machines. Similarly, another example are the databases that various law enforcement agencies keep of known “disapproved” files that they want to search peoples hard drives for. In these applications, keeping a database of the actual file contents, and/or transmitting and comparing those entire contents, would be impractical. Instead, only hashes are stored and compared.</p>
<p>More broadly, secure hash functions are useful in a variety of cases where we need a trapdoor function (i.e. one that cannot feasibly be reversed), especially where we need one with a limited or fixed-size result.</p>
<p>As mentioned, secure hashes are sometimes called message digests. And in fact, the main class for computing them in Java is java.security.MessageDigest. We get an instance of MessageDigest, feed it an array (or several arrays) of bytes, then call its digest() method to get the resulting hash:</p>
<figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">byte</span>[] data = ....</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">MessageDigest md = MessageDigest.getInstance(<span class="string">"SHA-1"</span>);</span><br><span class="line">md.update(data);</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">byte</span>[] hash = md.digest();</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<h2 id="MD5"><a href="#MD5" class="headerlink" title="MD5"></a>MD5</h2><p>MD5 is a later hash function developed by Ron Rivest. It is one of the most common hash algorithms in use today. Like MD2, it is a 128-bit hash function but, unlike its predecessor, it is one of the fastest “secure” hash functions in common use, and the fastest provided in Java 6.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is now considered insecure. Aside from the relatively small hash size, there are well-published methods to find collisions analytically in a trivial amount of time. For example, Vlastimil Klima has published a C program to find MD5 collisions in around 30 seconds on an average PC. If you need security, dont use MD5!</p>
<p>Although insecure, MD5 still makes a good general strong hash function due to its speed. In non-security applications such as finding duplicate files on a hard disk (where you are not trying to protect against the threat model of somebody deliberately fooling your system), MD5 makes a good choice.</p>
<h2 id="SHA-algorithms"><a href="#SHA-algorithms" class="headerlink" title="SHA algorithms"></a>SHA algorithms</h2><p>SHA (Secure Hash Algorithm) refers collectively to various hash functions developed by the US National Security Agency (NSA). The various algorithms are based on differing hash sizes and (in principle) offer corresponding levels of security:</p>
<h1 id="PBE-password-based-encryption"><a href="#PBE-password-based-encryption" class="headerlink" title="PBE  password-based encryption"></a>PBE  password-based encryption</h1><p>The technique of generating a secret key from a user-generated passphrase is usually called password-based encryption (PBE). As you might imagine, it is fraught with difficulty. In particular:</p>
<ul>
<li>the user is requirement and the security requirement usually conflict: the user requires an easy-to-remember passphrase, or at least one that is made of recognisable characters and short enough to write down; yet for secure encryption by today is standards, we require at least 128 strongly random bits (and ideally more);</li>
<li>password-based encryption is typically used in applications where an attacker can repeatedly try to guess the password undetected and beyond the control of the genuine sender/recipient (if the password is being used to log into our server, we can detect that so many invalid attempts were made and in the worst case shut down our server to prevent further attempts; but if an eavesdropper takes a copy of the encrypted ZIP file we e-mailed, we will never know that they are sitting there with a 100,000-processor botnet trying to brute-force the password, and they can essentially sit doing it for as long as they like).<br>The typical result is fairly dire: most password-protected data is encrypted with weak encryption keys, and an attacker can spend all the processor time they like trying to guess that weak key with complete impunity.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="How-to-use-PBE"><a href="#How-to-use-PBE" class="headerlink" title="How to use PBE"></a>How to use PBE</h2><p>There are two fundamental problems:<br>(a) user-memorable passwords typically dont contain as much randomness as we need for a secure key;<br>(b) in a typical application, an attacker gets as many tries as they like at the password. An additional problem is that if, say, the password abc123 always generated the same key in our application, then an attacker could calculate the key from this password once and then quickly decrypt any data protected with this password.</p>
<p>Two common techniques are used in password-based encryption to try to alleviate these problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>a deliberately slow method is used to derive the encryption key from the password, reducing the number of guesses that an attacker can make in a given time frame;</li>
<li>some random bytes, called a salt, are appended to the password before it is used to calculate the key.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Cryptographic-hash-function"><a href="#Cryptographic-hash-function" class="headerlink" title="Cryptographic hash function"></a>Cryptographic hash function</h1><ul>
<li>A cryptographic hash function is a special class of hash function that has certain properties which make it suitable for use in cryptography. <strong>It is a mathematical algorithm that maps data of arbitrary size to a bit string of a fixed size</strong> (a hash function) which is designed to also be <strong>a one-way function</strong>, that is, a function which is infeasible to invert. The only way to recreate the input data from an ideal cryptographic hash function is output is <strong>to attempt a brute-force search</strong> of possible inputs to see if they produce a match. </li>
<li>Bruce Schneier has called one-way hash functions the workhorses of modern cryptography.[1] The input data is often called the message, and the output (the hash value or hash) is often called the message digest or simply the <code>digest</code>.</li>
<li>in information-security contexts, cryptographic hash values are sometimes called (digital) fingerprints, checksums, or just hash values, even though all these terms stand for more general functions with rather different properties and purposes.</li>
<li>Another finalist from the NIST hash function competition, BLAKE, was optimized to produce BLAKE2 which is notable for being faster than SHA-3, SHA-2, SHA-1, or MD5, and is used in numerous applications and libraries.</li>

<li>it is deterministic so the same message always results in the same hash</li>
<li>it is quick to compute the hash value for any given message</li>
<li>it is infeasible to generate a message from its hash value except by trying all possible messages</li>
<li>a small change to a message should change the hash value so extensively that the new hash value appears uncorrelated with the old hash value</li>
<li>it is infeasible to find two different messages with the same hash value</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Illustration"><a href="#Illustration" class="headerlink" title="Illustration"></a>Illustration</h3><ul>
<li>An illustration of the potential use of a cryptographic hash is as follows: Alice poses a tough math problem to Bob and claims she has solved it. Bob would like to try it himself, but would yet like to be sure that Alice is not bluffing. Therefore, Alice writes down her solution, computes its hash and tells Bob the hash value (whilst keeping the solution secret). Then, when Bob comes up with the solution himself a few days later, Alice can prove that she had the solution earlier by revealing it and having Bob hash it and check that it matches the hash value given to him before. (This is an example of a simple commitment scheme; in actual practice, Alice and Bob will often be computer programs, and the secret would be something less easily spoofed than a claimed puzzle solution).</li>

<li>An important application of secure hashes is verification of message integrity. Determining whether any changes have been made to a message (or a file), for example, can be accomplished by comparing message digests calculated before, and after, transmission (or any other event).</li>
<li>For this reason, most digital signature algorithms only confirm the authenticity of a hashed digest of the message to be “signed”. Verifying the authenticity of a hashed digest of the message is considered proof that the message itself is authentic.</li>
<li><strong>MD5, SHA1, or SHA2 hashes</strong> are sometimes posted along with files on websites or forums to allow verification of integrity.[6] This practice establishes a chain of trust so long as the hashes are posted on a site authenticated by HTTPS.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Password-verification"><a href="#Password-verification" class="headerlink" title="Password verification"></a>Password verification</h4><ul>
<li>Storing all user passwords as cleartext can result in a massive security breach if the password file is compromised. One way to reduce this danger is to only store the hash digest of each password. To authenticate a user, the password presented by the user is hashed and compared with the stored hash. </li>
<li>The password is often concatenated with a random, non-secret salt value before the hash function is applied. The salt is stored with the password hash. Because users have different salts, it is not feasible to store tables of precomputed hash values for common passwords. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="MD5-1"><a href="#MD5-1" class="headerlink" title="MD5"></a>MD5</h2><ul>
<li>The MD5 algorithm is a widely used hash function producing a 128-bit hash value. Although MD5 was initially designed to be used as a cryptographic hash function, it has been found to suffer from extensive vulnerabilities. It can still be used as a checksum to verify data integrity, but only against unintentional corruption.</li>
<li>Like most hash functions, <strong>MD5 is neither encryption nor encoding</strong>. It <strong>can be reversed by brute-force attack</strong> and suffers from extensive vulnerabilities as detailed in the security section below.</li>
<li>MD5 was designed by Ronald Rivest in 1991 to replace an earlier hash function MD4.</li>
<li>The MD5 hash function receives its acronym MD from its structure using Merkle–Damg?rd construction.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Collision-resistance"><a href="#Collision-resistance" class="headerlink" title="Collision resistance"></a>Collision resistance</h3><ul>
<li>Collision resistance is a property of cryptographic hash functions: a hash function H is collision resistant if it is hard to find two inputs that hash to the same output; that is, two inputs a and b such that H(a) = H(b), and a ≠ b</li>
<li>Collision resistance does not mean that no collisions exist; simply that they are hard to find.</li>
<li>Cryptographic hash functions are usually designed to be collision resistant. But many hash functions that were once thought to be collision resistant were later broken. MD5 and SHA-1 in particular both have published techniques more efficient than brute force for finding collisions.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Rationale"><a href="#Rationale" class="headerlink" title="Rationale"></a>Rationale</h4><p>Collision resistance is desirable for several reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>In some digital signature systems, a party attests to a document by publishing a public key signature on a hash of the document. If it is possible to produce two documents with the same hash, an attacker could get a party to attest to one, and then claim that the party had attested to the other.</li>
<li>In some proof-of-work systems (e.g. bitcoin mining), users provide hash collisions as proof that they have performed a certain amount of computation to find them. If there is an easier way to find collisions than brute force, users can cheat the system.</li>
<li>In some distributed content systems, parties compare cryptographic hashes of files in order to make sure they have the same version. An attacker who could produce two files with the same hash could trick users into believing they had the same version of a file when they in fact did not.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Algorithm"><a href="#Algorithm" class="headerlink" title="Algorithm"></a>Algorithm</h4><ul>
<li>The Merkle–Damg?rd hash function first applies an MD-compliant padding function to create an input whose size is a multiple of a fixed number (e.g. 512 or 1024) — this is because compression functions cannot handle inputs of arbitrary size. The hash function then breaks the result into blocks of fixed size, and processes them one at a time with the compression function, each time combining a block of the input with the output of the previous round.[1]:146 In order to make the construction secure, Merkle and Damg?rd proposed that messages be padded with a padding that encodes the length of the original message. This is called <strong>length padding</strong> or Merkle–Damg?rd strengthening.</li>
<li>In the diagram, the one-way compression function is denoted by f, and transforms two fixed length inputs to an output of the same size as one of the inputs. The algorithm starts with an initial value, the initialization vector (IV). The IV is a fixed value (algorithm or implementation specific). For each message block, the compression (or compacting) function f takes the result so far, combines it with the message block, and produces an intermediate result. The last block is padded with zeros as needed and bits representing the length of the entire message are appended. (See below for a detailed length padding example.)</li>
<li>To harden the hash further the last result is then sometimes fed through a finalisation function. The finalisation function can have several purposes such as compressing a bigger internal state (the last result) into a smaller output hash size or to guarantee a better mixing and avalanche effect on the bits in the hash sum. The finalisation function is often built by using the compression function[citation needed] (Note that in some documents instead the act of length padding is called “finalisation”).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Merkle–Damg-rd-construction"><a href="#Merkle–Damg-rd-construction" class="headerlink" title="Merkle–Damg?rd construction"></a>Merkle–Damg?rd construction</h3><ul>
<li>In cryptography, the Merkle–Damg?rd construction or <strong>Merkle–Damg?rd hash function</strong> is a method of building collision-resistant cryptographic hash functions from collision-resistant one-way compression functions.[1]:145 This construction was used in the design of many popular hash algorithms such as MD5, SHA1 and SHA2.</li>
<li>The Merkle–Damg?rd construction was described in Ralph Merkles Ph.D. thesis in 1979.[2] Ralph Merkle and Ivan Damg?rd independently proved that the structure is sound: that is, if an appropriate padding scheme is used and the compression function is collision-resistant, then the hash function will also be collision resistant.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="SHA"><a href="#SHA" class="headerlink" title="SHA"></a>SHA</h2><ul>
<li>In cryptography, SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) is a cryptographic hash function designed by the United States National Security Agency and is a U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard published by the United States NIST.[2] SHA-1 produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value known as a message digest. A SHA-1 hash value is typically rendered as a hexadecimal number, 40 digits long.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Applications-1"><a href="#Applications-1" class="headerlink" title="Applications"></a>Applications</h3><ul>
<li>SHA-1 forms part of several widely used security applications and protocols, including TLS and SSL, PGP, SSH, S/MIME, and IPsec. Those applications can also use MD5; <strong>both MD5 and SHA-1 are descended from MD4</strong>. <strong>SHA-1 hashing is also used in distributed revision control systems like Git</strong>, Mercurial, and Monotone to identify revisions, and to detect data corruption or tampering. The algorithm has also been used on Nintendos Wii gaming console for signature verification when booting, but a significant flaw in the first implementations of the firmware allowed for an attacker to bypass the systems security scheme.</li>
<li>SHA-1 and SHA-2 are the secure hash algorithms required by law for use in certain U.S. Government applications, including use within other cryptographic algorithms and protocols, for the protection of sensitive unclassified information.</li>
<li>A prime motivation for the publication of the Secure Hash Algorithm was the Digital Signature Standard, in which it is incorporated.</li>
<li>Revision control systems such as Git and Mercurial use SHA-1 not for security but for ensuring that the data has not changed due to accidental corruption.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Salt-cryptography"><a href="#Salt-cryptography" class="headerlink" title="Salt (cryptography)"></a>Salt (cryptography)</h2><ul>
<li>In cryptography, a salt is random data that is used as an additional input to a one-way function that “hashes” a password or passphrase. Salts are closely related to the concept of nonce. The primary function of salts is to defend against dictionary attacks or against its hashed equivalent, a pre-computed rainbow table attack.[1]</li>
<li>Salts are used to safeguard passwords in storage. </li>
<li>The purpose of a hash and salt process in password security is not to prevent a password from being guessed, but to prevent a leaked password database from being used in further attacks.</li>
</ul>
<p>The idea of salt is that when the user enters the password, we dont actually use their raw password to generate the key. We first append some random bytes to the password. A new, random salt is used for every file/piece of data being encrypted. The salt bytes are not secret: they are stored unencrypted along side the encrypted data. This means that the salt bytes would add no extra security if there was only once piece of data in the world encrypted with a given password. But they prevent dictionary attacks, whereby an attacker pre-computes the keys from some common passwords and then tries those keys on the encrypted data. Without salt bytes, the dictionary attack would be worthwhile attack because we use a deliberately slow function to derive a key from a password. With the salt bytes, the attacker is forced to run the slow key derivation function for each password they want to try on each piece of data.</p>
<p>To generate salt bytes in Java, we just need to make sure that we use a secure random number generator. Construct an instance of SecureRandom, create (say) a 20-byte array, and call nextBytes() on that array:</p>
<figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">Random r = <span class="keyword">new</span> SecureRandom();</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">byte</span>[] salt = <span class="keyword">new</span> <span class="keyword">byte</span>[<span class="number">20</span>];</span><br><span class="line">r.nextBytes(salt);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<h1 id="Secure-Random"><a href="#Secure-Random" class="headerlink" title="Secure Random"></a>Secure Random</h1><p>The SecureRandom class, housed in the java.security package, provides a drop-in replacement to java.lang.Random. But unlike the latter, java.security.SecureRandom is designed to be cryptographically secure. </p>
<p>SecureRandom is typically used in cases where:</p>
<p>random numbers are generated for security related purposes, such as generating an encryption key or session ID (see below);<br>or, more generally, high-quality randomness is important and it is worth consuming CPU (or where CPU consumption is not an issue) to generate those high-quality random numbers.</p>
<h2 id="Properties-of-SecureRandom"><a href="#Properties-of-SecureRandom" class="headerlink" title="Properties of SecureRandom"></a>Properties of SecureRandom</h2><p>We said that SecureRandom is designed to be cryptographically secure. In practice, this means that the generator has the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>given only a number produced by the generator, it is (to all intents and purposes) impossible to predict previous and future numbers;</li>
<li>the numbers produced contain no known biases;</li>
<li>the generator has a large period (in Suns standard implementation, based on the 160-bit SHA1 hash function, the period is 2160);</li>
<li>the generator can seed itself at any position within that period with equal probability (or at least, it comes so close to this goal, that we have no practical way of telling otherwise).</li>
</ul>
<p>These properties are important in various security applications. The first is important, for eaxmple, if we use the generator to produce, say, a session ID on a web server: we donot want user n to predict user n+1 s session ID. Similarly, we donot want a user in an Internet cafe, based on the session ID or encryption key that they are given to access a web site, to be able to predict the value assigned to a previous user on that machine.</p>
<h2 id="The-importance-of-producing-all-values-with-equal-probability"><a href="#The-importance-of-producing-all-values-with-equal-probability" class="headerlink" title="The importance of producing all values with equal probability"></a>The importance of producing all values with equal probability</h2><p>For example, let s say that we want to pick a 128-bit AES encryption key. The idea of a strong encryption algorithm such as AES is that in order for an adversary to guess the key by “brute force” (which we assume is the only possible means), they would have to try every single possible key in turn until they hit on the right one. By law of averages, we would expect them to find it after half as many guesses as there are possible keys. A 128-bit key has 2128 possible values, so on average, they would have to try 2127 keys. In decimal 2127 is a 39-digit number. Or put another way, trying a million million keys per second, it would take 5x1015 millennia to try 2127 keys. Not even the British government wants to decrypt your party invitations that badly. So with current mainstream technology1, a 128-bit key is in principle sufficient for most applications.</p>
<p>But these metrics hold true only if our key selection algorithm— i.e. our random number generator— genuinely can pick any of the possible keys. For example, we certainly should not choose the key as follows:</p>
<figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="comment">// This is WRONG!! Do not do this!</span></span><br><span class="line">Random ranGen = <span class="keyword">new</span> Random();</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">byte</span>[] aesKey = <span class="keyword">new</span> <span class="keyword">byte</span>[<span class="number">16</span>]; <span class="comment">// 16 bytes = 128 bits</span></span><br><span class="line">ranGen.nextBytes(aesKey);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>The problem here is that the period of java.util.Random is only 248. Even though we are generating a 128-bit key, we will only ever pick from a subset of 248 of the possible keys. Or put another way: an attacker need only try on average 247 keys, and will find our key by trial and error in a couple of days if they try just a thousand million keys per second. And as if that wasnot bad enough, they probably donot even need to try anywhere near 247: for reasons discussed earlier, there is a good chance that an instance of java.util.Random created within a couple of minutes of bootup will actually be seeded from a about one thousandth of the 248 possible values. This time, HM Sniffing Service doesnot even need expensive hardware to find the secret location of your housewarming party: a trip to Staples will give them all the computing power they need.</p>
<p>So as you’ve probably guessed, our solution to the problem is to use SecureRandom instead:</p>
<p>import java.security.SecureRandom;<br>..<br>Random ranGen = new SecureRandom();<br>byte[] aesKey = new byte[16]; // 16 bytes = 128 bits<br>ranGen.nextBytes(aesKey);<br>Now, there’s a good chance that any of the 2128 possible keys will be chosen.</p>
<p>Seeding of SecureRandom<br>In order to provide this property of choosing any seed with “equal” likelihood, (or at least, with no bias that is practically detectable), SecureRandom seeds itself from sources of entropy available from the local machine, such as timings of I/O events.</p>

<h2 id="Rainbow-table"><a href="#Rainbow-table" class="headerlink" title="Rainbow table"></a>Rainbow table</h2><ul>
<li>A rainbow table is a precomputed table for reversing cryptographic hash functions, <strong>usually for cracking password hashes</strong>. </li>
<li>Tables are <strong>usually used in recovering a plaintext password up to a certain length consisting of a limited set of characters</strong>. It is a practical example of a space/time trade-off, using less computer processing time and more storage than a brute-force attack which calculates a hash on every attempt, but more processing time and less storage than a simple lookup table with one entry per hash. </li>
<li>After gathering a password hash, using said hash as a password would fail since the authentication system would hash it a second time. In order to learn a users password, a password that produces the same hashed value must be found, usually through a brute-force or dictionary attack.</li>
<li>Use of a <strong>key derivation function that employs a salt</strong> makes this attack infeasible.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Passphrase"><a href="#Passphrase" class="headerlink" title="Passphrase"></a>Passphrase</h2><ul>
<li>A passphrase is a sequence of words or other text used to control access to a computer system, program or data. A passphrase is similar to a password in usage, but is generally longer for added security. Passphrases are often used to control both access to, and operation of, cryptographic programs and systems, especially those that derive an encryption key from a passphrase. The origin of the term is by analogy with password. The modern concept of passphrases is believed to have been invented by Sigmund N. Porter[1] in 1982.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Compared-to-password"><a href="#Compared-to-password" class="headerlink" title="Compared to password"></a>Compared to password</h3><ul>
<li>Passphrases differ from passwords. A password is usually short—six to ten characters. Such passwords may be adequate for various applications (if frequently changed, if chosen using an appropriate policy, if not found in dictionaries, if sufficiently random, and/or if the system prevents online guessing, etc.)</li>
<li>But passwords are typically not safe to use as keys for standalone security systems (e.g., encryption systems) that expose data to enable offline password guessing by an attacker.[citation needed] Passphrases are theoretically stronger, and so should make a better choice in these cases. First, they usually are (and always should be) much longer—20 to 30 characters or more is typical—making some kinds of brute force attacks entirely impractical. Second, if well chosen, they will not be found in any phrase or quote dictionary, so such dictionary attacks will be almost impossible. Third, they can be structured to be more easily memorable than passwords without being written down, reducing the risk of hardcopy theft.[citation needed] However, if a passphrase is not protected appropriately by the authenticator and the clear-text passphrase is revealed its use is no better than other passwords. For this reason it is recommended that passphrases not be reused across different or unique sites and services.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Dictionary-Attack"><a href="#Dictionary-Attack" class="headerlink" title="Dictionary Attack"></a>Dictionary Attack</h2><ul>
<li>In cryptanalysis and computer security, a dictionary attack is a technique for defeating a cipher or authentication mechanism by trying to determine its decryption key or passphrase by trying hundreds or sometimes millions of likely possibilities, such as words in a dictionary.</li>
<li>A dictionary attack is based on trying all the strings in a pre-arranged listing, typically derived from a list of words such as in a dictionary (hence the phrase dictionary attack).</li>
<li><strong>In contrast to a brute force attack</strong>, where a large proportion of the <strong>key space is searched systematically</strong>, a <strong>dictionary attack</strong> tries <strong>only those possibilities</strong> which are deemed <strong>most likely</strong> to succeed. </li>
<li>Dictionary attacks often succeed because many people have a tendency to choose short passwords that are ordinary words or common passwords, or simple variants obtained, for example, by appending a digit or punctuation character. Dictionary attacks are relatively easy to defeat, e.g. by using a passphrase or otherwise choosing a password that is not a simple variant of a word found in any dictionary or listing of commonly used passwords.</li>
<li>It is possible to achieve a time-space tradeoff by pre-computing a list of hashes of dictionary words, and storing these in a database using the hash as the key. This requires a considerable amount of preparation time, but allows the actual attack to be executed faster. </li>
<li>A more refined approach involves the use of rainbow tables, which reduce storage requirements at the cost of slightly longer lookup times. </li>
<li><strong>Pre-computed dictionary attacks, or “rainbow table attacks”, can be thwarted by the use of salt</strong>, a technique that forces the hash dictionary to be recomputed for each password sought, making precomputation infeasible provided the number of possible salt values is large enough.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Avalanche-effect"><a href="#Avalanche-effect" class="headerlink" title="Avalanche effect"></a>Avalanche effect</h1><ul>
<li>In cryptography, the avalanche effect is the desirable property of cryptographic algorithms, typically block ciphers and cryptographic hash functions wherein if when an input is changed slightly (for example, flipping a single bit) the output changes significantly (e.g., half the output bits flip). In the case of high-quality block ciphers, such a small change in either the key or the plaintext should cause a drastic change in the ciphertext. The actual term was first used by Horst Feistel,[1] although the concept dates back to at least Shannon’s diffusion.</li>
<li>The SHA-1 hash function exhibits good avalanche effect. When a single bit is changed the hash sum becomes completely different. If a block cipher or cryptographic <strong>hash function does not exhibit the avalanche effect to a significant degree, then it has poor randomization</strong>, and thus a cryptanalyst can make predictions about the input, being given only the output. This may be sufficient to partially or completely break the algorithm. Thus, the avalanche effect is a desirable condition from the point of view of the designer of the cryptographic algorithm or device.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Public-key-cryptography"><a href="#Public-key-cryptography" class="headerlink" title="Public-key cryptography"></a>Public-key cryptography</h1><ul>
<li>An unpredictable (typically large and random) number is used to begin generation of an acceptable pair of keys suitable for use by an asymmetric key algorithm.</li>
<li>In an asymmetric key encryption scheme, anyone can encrypt messages using the public key, but only the holder of the paired private key can decrypt. Security depends on the secrecy of the private key.</li>
<li>In the Diffie–Hellman key exchange scheme, each party generates a public/private key pair and distributes the public key. After obtaining an authentic copy of each other’s public keys, Alice and Bob can compute a shared secret offline. The shared secret can be used, for instance, as the key for a symmetric cipher.</li>
<li>Public key cryptography, or asymmetric cryptography, is any cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys: public keys which may be disseminated widely, and private keys which are known only to the owner. This accomplishes two functions: <strong>authentication</strong>, which is when the public key is used to verify that a holder of the paired private key sent the message, and <strong>encryption</strong>, whereby only the holder of the paired private key can decrypt the message encrypted with the public key.</li>
<li>In a public key encryption system, any person can encrypt a message using the public key of the receiver, but such a message can be decrypted only with the receiver’s private key. For this to work it must be computationally easy for a user to generate a public and private key-pair to be used for encryption and decryption. The strength of a public key cryptography system relies on the degree of difficulty (computational impracticality) for a properly generated private key to be determined from its corresponding public key. Security then depends only on keeping the private key private, and the public key may be published without compromising security.</li>
<li>Because of the computational complexity of asymmetric encryption, it is usually used only for small blocks of data, typically the transfer of a symmetric encryption key (e.g. a session key). This symmetric key is then used to encrypt the rest of the potentially long message sequence. The symmetric encryption/decryption is based on simpler algorithms and is much faster.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Usage-of-public-key"><a href="#Usage-of-public-key" class="headerlink" title="Usage of public key"></a>Usage of public key</h2><p>Two of the best-known uses of public key cryptography are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Public key encryption</strong>, in which a message is encrypted with a recipient’s public key. The message cannot be decrypted by anyone who does not possess the matching private key, who is thus presumed to be the owner of that key and the person associated with the public key. This is used in an attempt to ensure confidentiality.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Digital signatures</strong>, in which a message is signed with the sender’s private key and can be verified by anyone who has access to the sender’s public key. This verification proves that the sender had access to the private key, and therefore is likely to be the person associated with the public key. This also ensures that the message has not been tampered with, as a signature is mathematically bound to the message it originally was made with, and verification will fail for practically any other message, no matter how similar to the original message.</p>
</li>
<li><p>An analogy to public key encryption is that of a locked mail box with a mail slot. The mail slot is exposed and accessible to the public – its location (the street address) is, in essence, the public key. Anyone knowing the street address can go to the door and drop a written message through the slot. However, only the person who possesses the key can open the mailbox and read the message.</p>
</li>
<li><p>An analogy for digital signatures is the sealing of an envelope with a personal wax seal. The message can be opened by anyone, but the presence of the unique seal authenticates the sender.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Problems-of-public-generated-key"><a href="#Problems-of-public-generated-key" class="headerlink" title="Problems of public generated key"></a>Problems of public generated key</h2><ul>
<li>A central problem with the use of public key cryptography is confidence/proof that a particular public key is authentic, in that it is correct and belongs to the person or entity claimed, and has not been tampered with or replaced by a malicious third party. The usual approach to this problem is to use a public key infrastructure (PKI), in which one or more third parties – known as certificate authorities – certify ownership of key pairs. PGP, in addition to being a certificate authority structure, has used a scheme generally called the “web of trust”, which decentralizes such authentication of public keys by a central mechanism, and substitutes individual endorsements of the link between user and public key. To date, no fully satisfactory solution to the “public key authentication problem” has been found</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="RSA"><a href="#RSA" class="headerlink" title="RSA"></a>RSA</h1><ul>
<li>RSA is one of the first practical public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission. In such a cryptosystem, the encryption key is public and differs from the decryption key which is kept secret. In RSA, this asymmetry is based on the practical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers, the factoring problem. RSA is made of the initial letters of the surnames of Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adleman, who first publicly described the algorithm in 1977. </li>
<li>A user of RSA creates and then publishes a public key based on two large prime numbers, along with an auxiliary value. The prime numbers must be kept secret. Anyone can use the public key to encrypt a message, but with currently published methods, if the public key is large enough, only someone with knowledge of the prime numbers can feasibly decode the message.[2] Breaking RSA encryption is known as the RSA problem; whether it is as hard as the factoring problem remains an open question.</li>
<li>RSA is a relatively slow algorithm, and because of this it is less commonly used to directly encrypt user data. More often, RSA passes encrypted shared keys for symmetric key cryptography which in turn can perform bulk encryption-decryption operations at much higher speed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Operation"><a href="#Operation" class="headerlink" title="Operation"></a>Operation</h2><ul>
<li>The RSA algorithm involves four steps: key generation, key distribution, encryption and decryption.</li>
<li>RSA involves a public key and a private key. The public key can be known by everyone and is used for encrypting messages. The intention is that messages encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted in a reasonable amount of time using the private key.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Symmetric-key-algorithm"><a href="#Symmetric-key-algorithm" class="headerlink" title="Symmetric-key algorithm"></a>Symmetric-key algorithm</h1><ul>
<li>Symmetric-key algorithms[1] are algorithms for cryptography that use the same cryptographic keys for both encryption of plaintext and decryption of ciphertext. The keys may be identical or there may be a simple transformation to go between the two keys</li>
<li>The keys, in practice, represent a shared secret between two or more parties that can be used to maintain a private information link.</li>
<li>This requirement that both parties have access to the secret key is one of the main drawbacks of symmetric key encryption, in comparison to public-key encryption (also known as asymmetric key encryption)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Implementations"><a href="#Implementations" class="headerlink" title="Implementations"></a>Implementations</h2><ul>
<li>Examples of popular symmetric algorithms include Twofish, Serpent, <strong>AES</strong> (Rijndael), <strong>Blowfish</strong>, CAST5, Kuznyechik, RC4, <strong>3DES</strong>, Skipjack, Safer+/++ (Bluetooth), and IDEA.[5][6]</li>

<li>Your classes were recompiled, and you’re getting ClassCastExceptions that you shouldn’t.<br>Solution</li>
<li>Run serialver to generate a “serial version UUID” and paste its output into your classes before you start. Or use your IDE’s tools for this purpose.<br>Discussion</li>
<li>When a class is undergoing a period of evolution—particularly a class being used in a networking context such as RMI or servlets—it may be useful to provide a serialVersionUID value in this class. This is a long that is basically a hash of the methods and fields in the class. Both the object serialization API (see Saving and Restoring Java Objects) and the JVM, when asked to cast one object to another (common when using collections, as in Chapter 7), either look up or, if not found, compute this value. If the value on the source and destination do not match, a ClassCastException is thrown. Most of the time, this is the correct thing for Java to do.<br>However, sometimes you may want to allow a class to evolve in a compatible way, but you can’t immediately replace all instances in circulation. You must be willing to write code to account for the additional fields being discarded if restoring from the longer format to the shorter and having the default value (null for objects, 0 for numbers, and false for Boolean) if you’re restoring from the shorter format to the longer. If you are only adding fields and methods in a reasonably compatible way, you can control the compatibility by providing a long int named serialVersionUID. The initial value should be obtained from a JDK tool called serialver, which takes just the class name. Consider a simple class called SerializableUser:<figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="class"><span class="keyword">class</span> <span class="title">SerializableUser</span> <span class="keyword">implements</span> <span class="title">java</span>.<span class="title">io</span>.<span class="title">Serializable</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">public</span> String name;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">public</span> String address;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">public</span> String country;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">public</span> String phoneNum;</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="comment">// other fields, and methods, here...</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">static</span> <span class="keyword">final</span> <span class="keyword">long</span> serialVersionUID = -<span class="number">7978489268769667877L</span>;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

</li>
</ul>
<p>I first compiled it with two different compilers to ensure that the value is a product of the class structure, not of some minor differences in class file format that different compilers might emit:</p>
<figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$ javac SerializableUser.java</span><br><span class="line">$ serialver SerializableUser</span><br><span class="line">SerializableUser:    static final long serialVersionUID = -7978489268769667877L;</span><br><span class="line">$ jikes +E SerializableUser.java</span><br><span class="line">$ serialver SerializableUser</span><br><span class="line">SerializableUser:    static final long serialVersionUID = -7978489268769667877L;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Sure enough, the class file from both compilers has the same hash. Now let’s change the file. I go in with an editor and add a new field, phoneNum, right after country:</p>
<figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"> <span class="keyword">public</span> String country;</span><br><span class="line"><span class="keyword">public</span> String phoneNum;      <span class="comment">// Added this line.</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$ javac SerializableUser.java</span><br><span class="line">$ serialver SerializableUser</span><br><span class="line">SerializableUser:    static final long serialVersionUID = -8339341455288589756L;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Notice how the addition of the field changed the serialVersionUID! Now, if I had wanted this class to evolve in a compatible fashion, here’s what I should have done before I started expanding it.

<li>Now all is well: I can interchange serialized versions of this file.<br>Note that serialver is part of the “object serialization” mechanism, and, therefore, it is meaningful only on classes that implement the Serializable interface described in Saving and Restoring Java Objects.<br>Note also that some developers use serialVersionUID values that start at 1 (a choice offered by some IDEs when they note that a class that appears to be serializable lacks a serialVersionUID), and then simply increment it by one each time the class changes in an incompatible way.</li>

However, it exists mostly for historical reasons; it defers its actions to the access controller.</p>

<ul>

<li>In Java 2, only classes in the core API are considered trusted. Other classes must be given explicit permission to perform the operations we’ve discussed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Summary"><a href="#Summary" class="headerlink" title="Summary"></a>Summary</h2><p>Although the security manager is the most commonly known feature of Java’s security story, it’s often misunderstood: there is no standard security manager among Java implementations, and Java applications, by default, have no security manager at all.</p>
<h1 id="Access-Controller"><a href="#Access-Controller" class="headerlink" title="Access Controller"></a>Access Controller</h1><ul>
<li>The implementation of most security managers, however, is based entirely upon the access controller.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Permissions"><a href="#Permissions" class="headerlink" title="Permissions"></a>Permissions</h2><ul>
<li>The basic entity that the access controller operates on is a permission object −− an instance of the Permission class (java.security.Permission). This class, of course, is the basis of the types that are listed in a policy file for the default security policy. The Permission class itself is an abstract class that represents a particular operation. The nomenclature here is a little misleading because a permission object can reflect two things. When it is associated with a class (through a code source and a protection domain), a permission object represents an actual permission that has been granted to that class. Otherwise, a permission object allows us to ask if we have a specific permission.</li>
<li>For example, if we construct a permission object that represents access to a file, possession of that object does not mean we have permission to access the file. Rather, possession of the object allows us to ask if we have permission to access the file.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="The-access-controller-is-built-upon-the-four-concepts"><a href="#The-access-controller-is-built-upon-the-four-concepts" class="headerlink" title="The access controller is built upon the four concepts"></a>The access controller is built upon the four concepts</h2><ul>
<li>Code sources<br>An encapsulation of the location from which certain Java classes were obtained.</li>
<li>Permissions<br>An encapsulation of a request to perform a particular operation.</li>
<li>Policies<br>An encapsulation of all the specific permissions that should be granted to specific code sources.</li>
<li>Protection domains<br>An encapsulation of a particular code source and the permissions granted to that code source.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Byte-code-verifier"><a href="#Byte-code-verifier" class="headerlink" title="Byte code verifier"></a>Byte code verifier</h1><ul>
<li>The verifier is often referred to as a <code>mini−theorem prover</code> (a term first used in several documents from Sun). This sounds somewhat more impressive than it is; it’s not a generic, all−purpose theorem prover by any means. Instead, it’s a piece of code that can prove one (and only one) thing −− that a given series of ( Java) bytecodes represents a legal set of ( Java) instructions.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Shifting"><a href="#Shifting" class="headerlink" title="Shifting"></a>Shifting</h1><p>Java and JavaScript perform sign extension when shift¬ing right, filling the empty spaces with 1’s for negative numbers, so 10100110 &gt;&gt; 5 becomes 11111101.<br>The &gt;&gt;&gt; operator is unique to Java and JavaScript. It does a logical shift right, filling the empty spaces with 0 no matter what the value, so 10100110 &gt;&gt;&gt; 5 becomes 00000101.</p>
<p>The shift operators enable you to multiply and divide by powers of 2 very quickly. For non-negative numbers, shifting to the right one bit is equivalent to dividing by 2, and shifting to the left one bit is equivalent to multiplying by 2. For negative numbers, it obviously depends on the language being used.</p>
<h2 id="Specifically-the-bytecode-verifier-can-prove-the-following"><a href="#Specifically-the-bytecode-verifier-can-prove-the-following" class="headerlink" title="Specifically, the bytecode verifier can prove the following:"></a>Specifically, the bytecode verifier can prove the following:</h2><ul>
<li>The class file has the correct format. The full definition of the class file format may be found in the Java virtual machine specification; the bytecode verifier is responsible for making sure that the class file has the right length, the correct magic numbers in the correct places, and so on.</li>
<li>Final classes are not subclassed, and final methods are not overridden.</li>
<li>Every class (except for java.lang.Object) has a single superclass.</li>
<li>There is no illegal data conversion of primitive data types (e.g., int to Object).</li>
<li>No illegal data conversion of objects occurs. Because the casting of a superclass to its subclass may<br>be a valid operation (depending on the actual type of the object being cast), the verifier cannot ensure that such casting is not attempted −− it can only ensure that before each such attempt is made, the legality of the cast is tested.</li>
<li>There are no operand stack overflows or underflows.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Stacks"><a href="#Stacks" class="headerlink" title="Stacks"></a>Stacks</h2><ul>
<li>In Java, there are two stacks for each thread. One stack holds a series of method frames, where each method frame holds the local variables and other storage for a particular method invocation. This stack is known as the data stack and is what we normally think of as the stack within a traditional program. The bytecode verifier cannot prevent overflow of this stack −− an infinitely recursive method call will cause this stack to overflow. However, each method invocation requires a second stack (which itself is allocated on the data stack) that is referred to as the operand stack; the operand stack holds the values that the Java bytecodes operate on. This secondary stack is the stack that the bytecode verifier can ensure will not overflow or underflow.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Security-Manager"><a href="#Security-Manager" class="headerlink" title="Security Manager"></a>Security Manager</h1><ul>
<li>The implementation of the sandbox depends on three things:</li>
<li>The security manager, which provides the mechanism that the Java API uses to see if security−related operations are allowed.</li>
<li>The access controller, which provides the basis of the default implementation of the security manager. </li>
<li>The class loader, which encapsulates information about security policies and classes.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll start by examining the security manager. From the perspective of the Java API, there is a security manager that actually is in control of the security policy of an application. The purpose of the security manager is to determine whether particular operations should be permitted or denied. In truth, the purpose of the access controller is really the same: it decides whether access to a critical system resource should be permitted or denied. Hence, the access controller can do everything the security manager can do.</p>
<p><strong>The reason there is both an access controller and a security manager is mainly historical</strong>: the access controller is only available in Java 2 and subsequent releases. Before the access controller existed, the security manager relied on its internal logic to determine the security policy that should be in effect, and changing the security policy required changing the security manager itself. Starting with Java 2, the security manager defers these decisions to the access controller. Since the security policy enforced by the access controller can be specified by using policy files, this allows a much more flexible mechanism for determining policies. The access controller also gives us a much simpler method of granting fine−grained, specific permissions to specific classes. That process was theoretically possibly with the security manager alone, but it was simply too hard to implement.</p>
<h2 id="The-BasicPermission-class"><a href="#The-BasicPermission-class" class="headerlink" title="The BasicPermission class"></a>The BasicPermission class</h2><ul>
<li><p>If you need to implement your own permission class, the BasicPermission class (java.security.BasicPermission) provides some useful semantics. This class implements a basic permission −− that is, a permission that doesn’t have actions. Basic permissions can be thought of as binary permissions −− you either have them or you don’t. However, this restriction does not prevent you from implementing actions in your subclasses of the BasicPermission class (as the PropertyPermission class does).</p>
</li>
<li><p>The prime benefit of this class is the manner in which it implements wildcards. Names in basic permissions are considered to be hierarchical, following a dot−separated convention. For example, if the XYZ corporation wanted to create a set of basic permissions, they might use the convention that the first word of the permission always be xyz: xyz.readDatabase, xyz.writeDatabase, xyz.runPayrollProgram, xyz.HRDepartment.accessCheck, and so on. These permissions can then be specified by their full name, or they can be specified with an asterisk wildcard: xyz.* would match each of these (no matter what depth), and * would match every possible basic permission.</p>

</li>
<li><p>保护密码的最好办法是使用加盐密码哈希（ salted password hashing）。</p>
</li>
<li><p>永远不要告诉用户输错的究竟是用户名还是密码。就像通用的提示那样，始终显示：“无效的用户名或密码。”就行了。这样可以防止攻击者在不知道密码的情况下枚举出有效的用户名。</p>
</li>
<li><p>应当注意的是，用来保护密码的哈希函数，和数据结构课学到的哈希函数是不同的。例如，实现哈希表的哈希函数设计目的是快速查找，而非安全性。只有加密哈希函数（ cryptographic hash function）才可以用来进行密码哈希加密。像 SHA256 、 SHA512 、 RIPEMD 和 WHIRLPOOL 都是加密哈希函数。</p>
</li>
<li><p>破解哈希加密最简单的方法是尝试猜测密码，哈希每个猜测的密码，并对比猜测密码的哈希值是否等于被破解的哈希值。如果相等，则猜中。猜测密码攻击的两种最常见的方法是字典攻击和暴力攻击 。</p>
</li>
<li><p>字典攻击使用包含单词、短语、常用密码和其他可能用做密码的字符串的字典文件。对文件中的每个词都进行哈希加密，将这些哈希值和要破解的密码哈希值比较。如果它们相同，这个词就是密码。字典文件是通过大段文本中提取的单词构成，甚至还包括一些数据库中真实的密码。还可以对字典文件进一步处理以使其更为有效：如单词 “hello” 按网络用语写法转成 “h3110” 。</p>
</li>
<li><p>暴力攻击是对于给定的密码长度，尝试每一种可能的字符组合。这种方式会消耗大量的计算，也是破解哈希加密效率最低的办法，但最终会找出正确的密码。因此密码应该足够长，以至于遍历所有可能的字符组合，耗费的时间太长令人无法承受，从而放弃破解。</p>
</li>
<li><p>目前没有办法来组织字典攻击或暴力攻击。只能想办法让它们变得低效。如果密码哈希系统设计是安全的，破解哈希的唯一方法就是进行字典攻击或暴力攻击遍历每一个哈希值了。</p>
</li>
<li><p>我们可以通过在密码中加入一段随机字符串再进行哈希加密，这个被加的字符串称之为盐值。如上例所示，这使得相同的密码每次都被加密为完全不同的字符串。我们需要盐值来校验密码是否正确。通常和密码哈希值一同存储在帐号数据库中，或者作为哈希字符串的一部分。</p>
</li>
<li><p>盐值无需加密。由于随机化了哈希值，查表法、反向查表法和彩虹表都会失效。因为攻击者无法事先知道盐值，所以他们就没有办法预先计算查询表或彩虹表。如果每个用户的密码用不同的盐再进行哈希加密，那么反向查表法攻击也将不能奏效。</p>
</li>
<li><p>一个常见的错误是每次都使用相同的盐值进行哈希加密，这个盐值要么被硬编码到程序里，要么只在第一次使用时随机获得。这样的做法是无效的，因为如果两个用户有相同的密码，他们仍然会有相同的哈希值。攻击者仍然可以使用反向查表法对每个哈希值进行字典攻击。他们只是在哈希密码之前，将固定的盐值应用到每个猜测的密码就可以了。如果盐值被硬编码到一个流行的软件里，那么查询表和彩虹表可以内置该盐值，以使其更容易破解它产生的哈希值。</p>
</li>
<li><p>用户创建帐号或者更改密码时，都应该用新的随机盐值进行加密。</p>
</li>
<li><p>出于同样的原因，不应该将用户名用作盐值。对每一个服务来说，用户名是唯一的，但它们是可预测的，并且经常重复应用于其他服务。攻击者可以用常见用户名作为盐值来建立查询表和彩虹表来破解密码哈希。</p>
</li>
<li><p>为使攻击者无法构造包含所有可能盐值的查询表，盐值必须足够长。一个好的经验是使用和哈希函数输出的字符串等长的盐值。例如， SHA256 的输出为256位（32字节），所以该盐也应该是32个随机字节。</p>
</li>
<li><p>每个用户的每一个密码都要使用独一无二的盐值。用户每次创建帐号或更改密码时，密码应采用一个新的随机盐值。永远不要重复使用某个盐值。这个盐值也应该足够长，以使有足够多的盐值能用于哈希加密。一个经验规则是，盐值至少要跟哈希函数的输出一样长。该盐应和密码哈希一起存储在用户帐号表中。</p>
</li>
<li><p>存储密码的步骤：</p>
<ul>
<li>使用 CSPRNG 生成足够长的随机盐值。</li>
<li>将盐值混入密码，并使用标准的密码哈希函数进行加密，如Argon2、 bcrypt 、 scrypt 或 PBKDF2 。</li>
<li>将盐值和对应的哈希值一起存入用户数据库。</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>校验密码的步骤：</p>
<ul>
<li>从数据库检索出用户的盐值和对应的哈希值。</li>
<li>将盐值混入用户输入的密码，并且使用通用的哈希函数进行加密。</li>
<li>比较上一步的结果，是否和数据库存储的哈希值相同。如果它们相同，则表明密码是正确的；否则，该密码错误。</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Within IoC container, a spring bean is created using class constructor. </li>
<li>Now the dependency injection is performed using setter method. </li>

<li>Now &lt; code&gt;BeanClassLoaderAware.setBeanClassLoader() is called that supplies the bean class loader to a bean instance. </li>
<li>Now &lt; code&gt;BeanFactoryAware.setBeanFactory() is called that provides the owning factory to a bean instance. </li>
<li>Now the IoC container calls BeanPostProcessor.postProcessBeforeInitialization on the bean. Using this method a wrapper can be applied on original bean. </li>
<li>Now the method annotated with @PostConstruct is called. </li>
<li>After @PostConstruct, the method InitializingBean.afterPropertiesSet() is called. </li>
<li>Now the method specified by init-method attribute of bean in XML configuration is called. </li>
<li>And then BeanPostProcessor.postProcessAfterInitialization() is called. It can also be used to apply wrapper on original bean. </li>
<li>Now the bean instance is ready to be used. Perform the task using the bean. </li>
<li>Now when the ApplicationContext shuts down such as by using registerShutdownHook() then the method annotated with @PreDestroy is called. </li>

<li><p>In a Spring application, an application context loads bean definitions and wires them together. The Spring application context is fully responsible for the creation of and wiring of the objects that make up the application. Spring comes with several imple¬mentations of its application context, each primarily differing only in how it loads its configuration.</p>
</li>
<li><p>When the beans in knights.xml are declared in an XML file, an appropriate choice for application context might be ClassPathXmlApplicationContext.1</p>
</li>
<li><p>These system services are commonly referred to as cross-cut¬ting concerns because they tend to cut across multiple components in a system.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Your components are littered with code that isn’t aligned with their core func¬tionality. A method that adds an entry to an address book should only be con¬cerned with how to add the address and not with whether it’s secure or transactional.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Spring seeks to eliminate boilerplate code by encapsulating it in templates. Spring’s JdbcTemplate makes it possible to perform database operations without all the ceremony required by traditional JDBC.<br>The container is at the core of the Spring Framework. Spring’s container uses DI to manage the components that make up an application. This includes creating associa¬tions between collaborating components. As such, these objects are cleaner and easier to understand, they support reuse, and they’re easy to unit test.</p>
</li>
<li><p>There’s no single Spring container. Spring comes with several container imple¬mentations that can be categorized into two distinct types. Bean factories (defined by the org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanFactory interface) are the simplest of containers, providing basic support for DI. Application contexts (defined by the org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext interface) build on the notion of a bean factory by providing application-framework services, such as the ability to resolve textual messages from a properties file and the ability to publish application events to interested event listeners.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Although it’s possible to work with Spring using either bean factories or applica¬tion contexts, bean factories are often too low-level for most applications. Therefore, application contexts are preferred over bean factories. We’ll focus on working with application contexts and not spend any more time talking about bean factories.</p>
</li>
<li><p>As you can see, a bean factory performs several setup steps before a bean is ready to use. Let’s break down figure 1.5 in more detail:<br>1 Spring instantiates the bean.<br>2 Spring injects values and bean references into the bean’s properties.<br>3 If the bean implements BeanNameAware, Spring passes the bean’s ID to the set-BeanName() method.<br>4 If the bean implements BeanFactoryAware, Spring calls the setBeanFactory() method, passing in the bean factory itself.<br>5 If the bean implements ApplicationContextAware, Spring calls the set-ApplicationContext() method, passing in a reference to the enclosing appli¬cation context.<br>6       If the bean implements the BeanPostProcessor interface, Spring calls its post-<br>ProcessBeforeInitialization() method.<br>7       If the bean implements the InitializingBean interface, Spring calls its after-<br>PropertiesSet() method. Similarly, if the bean was declared with an init-method, then the specified initialization method is called.<br>8 If the bean implements BeanPostProcessor, Spring calls its postProcess-AfterInitialization() method.<br>9 At this point, the bean is ready to be used by the application and remains in the application context until the application context is destroyed.<br>10 If the bean implements the DisposableBean interface, Spring calls its destroy() method. Likewise, if the bean was declared with a destroy-method, the specified method is called.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Spring Boot heavily employs automatic configuration techniques that can elimi¬nate most (and in many cases, all) Spring configuration. It also provides several starter projects to help reduce the size of your Spring project build files, whether you’re using Maven or Gradle.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>·   Spring began to support Servlet 3.0, including the ability to declare servlets and filters in Java-based configuration instead of web.xml.<br>·   You should now have a good idea of what Spring brings to the table. Spring aims to make enterprise Java development easier and to promote loosely coupled code. Vital to this are dependency injection and aspect-oriented programming.<br>When it comes to expressing a bean wiring specification, Spring is incredibly flexible, offering three primary wiring mechanisms:<br>·   Explicit configuration in XML<br>·   Explicit configuration in Java<br>·   Implicit bean discovery and automatic wiring<br>·   in many cases, the choice is largely a matter of personal taste, and you’re welcome to choose the approach that feels best for you.<br>Spring attacks automatic wiring from two angles:<br>·   Component scanning—Spring automatically discovers beans to be created in the application context.<br>·   Autowiring—Spring automatically satisfies bean dependencies.<br>Working together, component scanning and autowiring are a powerful force and can help keep explicit configuration to a minimum.</p>

<li>The specifics of the CompactDisc interface aren’t important. What is important is that you’ve defined it as an interface.

<li><p>Note that the customerReady end state includes an <output> element. This ele-ment is a flow’s equivalent of Java’s return statement. It passes back some data from a subflow to the calling flow. In this case, <output> returns the customer flow variable so that the identifyCustomer subflow state in the pizza flow can assign it to the order.<br>you use the <input> element to pass the Order in to the flow. Here you’re using it to accept that Order object. If you think of this subflow as being analo¬gous to a method in Java, the <input> element used here is effectively defining the subflow’s signature. This flow requires a single parameter called order.</output></output></p>
</li>
<li><p>States, transitions, and entire flows can be secured in Spring Web Flow by using the <secured> element as a child of those elements. For example, to secure access to a view state, you might use <secured> like this:</secured></secured></p>
<view-state id="restricted">
<secured attributes="ROLE_ADMIN" match="all"> </secured></view-state>
As configured here, access to the view state will be restricted to only users who are granted ROLE_ADMIN access (per the attributes attribute). The attributes attribute takes a comma-separated list of authorities that the user must have to gain access to the state, transition, or flow.

</ul>
<p>On the contrary, REST has little to do with RPC. Whereas RPC is service oriented and focused on actions and verbs, REST is resource oriented, emphasizing the things and nouns that comprise an application.</p>
<p>Put more succinctly, REST is about transferring the state of resources—in a representational form that is most appropriate for the client or server—from a server to a client (or vice versa).</p>
<p>It’s a small start, but you’ll build on this controller throughout this chapter as you learn the ins and outs of Spring’s REST programming model.</p>
<p>Representation is an important facet of REST. It’s how a client and a server communicate about a resource. Any given resource can be represented in virtually any form. If the consumer of the resource prefers JSON, then the resource can be</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a human user viewing the resource in a web browser will likely prefer seeing it in HTML (or possibly PDF, Excel, or some other human-readable form). The resource doesn’t change—only how it’s represented.</p>
<p>Understanding how ContentNegotiatingViewResolverworks involves getting to know the content-negotiation two-step:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Determine the requested media type(s).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Find the best view for the requested media type(s).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The @ResponseBodyannotation tells Spring that you want to send the returned object as a resource to the client, converted into some representational form that the client can accept. More specifically, DispatcherServletconsiders the request’s Acceptheader and looks for a message converter that can give the client the representation it wants.</p>
<p>Just as @ResponseBodytells Spring to employ a message converter when sending data to a client, the @RequestBodytells Spring to find a message converter to convert a resource representation coming from a client into an object. For example, suppose that you need a way for a client to submit a new Spittle to be saved. You can write the controller method to handle such a request like this:</p>
<p>The body of the POST request is expected to carry a resource representation for a Spittle. Because the Spittleparameter is annotated with @RequestBody, Spring will look at the Content-Typeheader of the request and try to find a message converter that can convert the request body into a Spittle.</p>
<p>For example, if the client sent the Spittle data in a JSON representation, then the Content-Type header might be set to application/json. In that case, DispatcherServletwill look for a message converter that can convert JSON into Java objects. If the Jackson 2 library is on the classpath, then MappingJackson2Http-MessageConverterwill get the job and will convert the JSON representation into a Spittle that’s passed into the saveSpittle()method. The method is also annotated with @ResponseBodyso that the returned Spittle will be converted into a resource representation to be returned to the client.</p>
<p>Notice that the @RequestMappinghas a consumesattribute set to application/json. The consumesattribute works much like the producesattribute, only with regard to the request’s Content-Typeheader. This tells Spring that this method will only handle POSTrequests to /spittles if the request’s Content-Typeheader is application/json. Otherwise, it will be up to some other method (if a suitable one exists) to handle the request.</p>
<p>The key thing to notice in listing 16.3is what’s not in the code. Neither of the handler methods are annotated with @ResponseBody. But because the controller is annotated with @RestController, the objects returned from those methods will still go through message conversion to produce a resource representation for the client.The @ExceptionHandler annotation can be applied to controller methods to handle specific exceptions. Here, it’s indicating that if a SpittleNotFoundException is thrown from any of the handler methods in the same controller, the spittleNotFound() method should be called to handle that exception.</p>
<p>@ExceptionHandler(SpittleNotFoundException.class)@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND)public @ResponseBody Error spittleNotFound(SpittleNotFoundException e) {  long spittleId = e.getSpittleId();  return new Error(4, “Spittle [“ + spittleId + “] not found”);}</p>
<p>@ExceptionHandler(SpittleNotFoundException.class)<br>@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND)<br>public @ResponseBody Error spittleNotFound(SpittleNotFoundException e) {<br> long spittleId = e.getSpittleId();<br> return new Error(4, “Spittle [“ + spittleId + “] not found”);<br>}</p>
<p>Because spittleNotFound() always returns an Error, the only reason to keep Response-Entity around is so you can set the status code. But by annotating spittleNotFound() with @ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND), you can achieve the same effect and get rid of ResponseEntity.</p>
<p>Again, if the controller class is annotated with @RestController, you can remove the @ResponseBody annotation and clean up the code a little more:</p>
<p>@ExceptionHandler(SpittleNotFoundException.class)<br>@ResponseStatus(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND)<br>public Error spittleNotFound(SpittleNotFoundException e) {<br> long spittleId = e.getSpittleId();<br> return new Error(4, “Spittle [“ + spittleId + “] not found”);<br>}</p>
<p>public Spittle fetchSpittle(long id) {<br> RestTemplate rest = new RestTemplate();<br> ResponseEntity<spittle> response = rest.getForEntity(</spittle></p>
<pre><code>&quot;http://localhost:8080/spittr-api/spittles/{id}&quot;,
Spittle.class, id);</code></pre><p> if(response.getStatusCode() == HttpStatus.NOT_MODIFIED) {<br>   throw new NotModifiedException();<br> }<br> return response.getBody();<br>}</p>
<p>Just like the getForEntity() method, postForEntity() returns a Response-Entity<t> object. From that object, you can call getBody() to get the resource object (a Spitter in this case). And the getHeaders() method gives you an HttpHeaders from which you can access the various HTTP headers returned in the response. Here, you’re calling getLocation() to retrieve the Location header as a java.net.URI.</t></p>
<p>By passing in HttpMethod.GET as the HTTP verb, you’re asking exchange() to send a GET request. The third argument is for sending a resource on the request, but because this is a GET request, it can be null. The next argument indicates that you want the response converted into a Spitter object. An</p>
<p>Used this way, the exchange() method is virtually identical to the previously used getForEntity(). But unlike getForEntity()—or getForObject()—exchange() lets you set headers on the request sent. Instead of passing null to exchange(), you pass in an HttpEntity created with the request headers you want.</p>
<p>RESTful architecture uses web standards to integrate applications, keeping the interactions simple and natural. Resources in a system are identified by URLs, manipulated with HTTP methods, and represented in one or more forms suitable for the client.</p>
<p>Spring’s philosophy of avoiding checked exceptions, you don’t want to let the JMSException escape this method, so you’ll catch it instead.</p>
<p>In the catch block, you can use the convertJmsAccessException() method from Spring’s JmsUtils class to convert the checked JMSException to an unchecked JmsException. This is effectively the same thing JmsTemplate does for you in other cases.</p>
<p>A message-listener container is a special bean that watches a JMS destination, waiting for a message to arrive. Once a message arrives, the bean retrieves the message and passes it on to any message listeners that are interested.</p>
<p>&lt;jms:listener-container connection-factory=”connectionFactory”&gt;<br> &lt;jms:listener destination=”spitter.alert.queue”<br>      ref=”spittleHandler” method=”handleSpittleAlert” /&gt;<br></p>
<p>JmsInvokerServiceExporter is much like those other service exporters. In fact, note that there’s some symmetry in the names of JmsInvokerServiceExporter and HttpInvokerServiceExporter. If HttpInvokerServiceExporter exports services that communicate over HTTP, then JmsInvokerServiceExporter must export services that converse over JMS.</p>
<p>As it turns out, AMQP offers several advantages over JMS. First, AMQP defines a wire-level protocol for messaging, whereas JMS defines an API specification. JMS’s API specification ensures that all JMS implementations can be used through a common API but doesn’t mandate that messages sent by one JMS implementation can be consumed by a different JMS implementation. AMQP’s wire-level protocol, on the other hand, specifies the format that messages will take when en route between the producer and consumer. Consequently, AMQP is more interoperable than JMS—not only across different AMQP implementations, but also across languages and platforms.</p>
<p>In JMS, there are just three primary participants: the message producer, the message consumer(s), and a channel (either a queue or a topic) to carry the message between producers and consumers. These essentials of the JMS messaging model are illustrated in figures 17.3 and 17.4.</p>
<p>In JMS, the channel helps to decouple the producer from the consumer, but both are still coupled to the channel. A producer publishes messages to a specific queue or topic, and the consumer receives those message from a specific queue or topic. The channel has the double duty of relaying messages and determining how those messages will be routed; queues route using a point-to-point algorithm, and topics route in publish/subscribe fashion.</p>
<p>In contrast, AMQP producers don’t publish directly to a queue. Instead, AMQP introduces a new level of indirection between the producer and any queues that will carry the message: the exchange. This relationship is illustrated in figure 17.8.</p>
<p>Figure 17.8. In AMQP, message producers are decoupled from message queues by an exchange that handles message routing.</p>
<p>For example, to have a message routed to multiple queues with no regard for the routing key, you can configure a fanout exchange and several queues like this:</p>
<p><admin connection-factory="connectionFactory"> <queue name="spittle.alert.queue.1"> <queue name="spittle.alert.queue.2"> <queue name="spittle.alert.queue.3"> <fanout-exchange name="spittle.fanout"> <bindings> <binding queue="spittle.alert.queue.1"> <binding queue="spittle.alert.queue.2"> <binding queue="spittle.alert.queue.3"> </binding></binding></binding></bindings> </fanout-exchange></queue></queue></queue></admin></p>
<p>As its name implies, the RabbitMQ connection factory is used to create connections with RabbitMQ. If you want to send messages via RabbitMQ, you could inject the connectionFactory bean into your AlertServiceImpl class, use it to create a Connection, use that Connection to create a Channel, and use that Channel to publish a message to an exchange.</p>
<p>Yep, you could do that.</p>
<p>you can configure different defaults using the exchange and routing-key attributes on the <template> element:</template></p>
<p><template id="rabbitTemplate" connection-factory="connectionFactory" exchange="spittle.alert.exchange" routing-key="spittle.alerts"></template></p>
<p>it was tricky to convert domain objects into Messages for sending, it’s messy to convert received Messages to domain objects. Therefore, consider using RabbitTemplate’s receiveAndConvert() method instead:</p>
<p>Spittle spittle =<br>   (Spittle) rabbit.receiveAndConvert(“spittle.alert.queue”);<br>Or you can leave the queue name out of the call parameters to fall back on the template’s default queue name:</p>
<p>The first thing you’ll need in order to consume a Spittle object asynchronously in a message-driven POJO is the POJO itself. Here’s SpittleAlertHandler, which fills that role:</p>
<p>package com.habuma.spittr.alerts;<br>import com.habuma.spittr.domain.Spittle;</p>
<p>public class SpittleAlertHandler {</p>
<p> public void handleSpittleAlert(Spittle spittle) {<br>   // … implementation goes here …<br> }<br>}</p>
<listener-container connection-factory="connectionFactory">
   <listener ref="spittleListener" method="handleSpittleAlert" queue-names="spittle.alert.queue">
</listener></listener-container>
Do you see the difference? I’ll agree that it’s not obvious. The <listener-container> and <listener> elements appear to be similar to their JMS counterparts. These elements, however, come from the rabbit namespace instead of the JMS namespace.

<p>I said it wasn’t obvious.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether you handle text messages, binary messages, or both, you might also be interested in handling the establishment and closing of connections. In that case, you can override afterConnectionEstablished() and afterConnectionClosed():</p>
<p>public void afterConnectionEstablished(WebSocketSession session)<br>   throws Exception {<br> logger.info(“Connection established”);<br>}</p>
<p>@Override<br>public void afterConnectionClosed(<br>   WebSocketSession session, CloseStatus status) throws Exception {<br> logger.info(“Connection closed. Status: “ + status);<br>}</p>
<p>Fortunately, you don’t have to work with raw WebSocket connections. Just as HTTP layers a request-response model on top of TCP sockets, STOMP layers a frame-based wire format to define messaging semantics on top of WebSocket.</p>
<p>At a quick glance, STOMP message frames look very similar in structure to HTTP requests. Much like HTTP requests and responses, STOMP frames are comprised of a command, one or more headers, and a payload. For example, here’s a STOMP frame that sends data.</p>
<p>SEND<br>destination:/app/marco<br>content-length:20</p>
<p>{&quot;message&quot;:&quot;Marco!&quot;}
In this simple example, the STOMP command is SEND, indicating that something is being sent. It’s followed by two headers: one indicates the destination where the message should be sent, and the other communicates the size of the payload. Following a blank line, the frame concludes with the payload; in this case, a JSON message.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of Maven’s and Gradle’s transitive dependency resolution, the starters declare several dependencies in their own pom.xml file. When you add one of these starter dependencies to your Maven or Gradle build, the starter’s dependencies are resolved transitively.</p>
<p>Whereas Spring Boot starters cut down the size of your build’s dependency list, Spring Boot autoconfiguration cuts down on the amount of Spring configuration.</p>
<p>When Spring Boot’s web autoconfiguration detects Spring MVC in the classpath, it will automatically configure several beans to support Spring MVC, including view resolvers, resource handlers, and message converters (among others). All that’s left for you to do is write the controller classes to handle the requests.</p>
<p>Spring Boot is an exciting new addition to the Spring family of projects. Where Spring aims to make Java development simpler, Spring Boot aims to make Spring itself simpler.</p>
<p>Spring Boot employs two main tricks to eliminate boilerplate configuration in a Spring project: Spring Boot starters and automatic configuration.</p>
<p>A single Spring Boot starter dependency can replace several common dependencies in a Maven or Gradle build. For example, adding only Spring Boot’s web starter as a dependency in a project pulls in Spring’s web and Spring MVC modules as well as the Jackson 2 databind module.</p>
<p>Automatic configuration takes full advantage of Spring 4.0’s conditional configuration feature to automatically configure certain Spring beans to enable a certain feature. For example, Spring Boot can detect that Thymeleaf is in the application classpath and automatically configure the beans required to enable Thymeleaf templates as Spring MVC views.</p>
<p>In addition to the MBean info assemblers you’ve seen thus far, Spring provides another assembler known as MetadataMBeanInfoAssembler that can be configured to use annotations to appoint bean methods as managed operations and attributes. I could show you</p>
<p>JTA transaction management is resource-intensive; its exception handling is based on checked exceptions and so is not developer-friendly. Moreover, unit testing is hard with EJB CMT.</p>
<p>Most applications just need local transactions since they do not deal with multiple servers or transactional resources such as databases, JMS, and JCA; hence, they do not need a full-blown application server. For distributed transactions spanned across multiple servers over remote calls, you need JTA, necessitating an application server, as JTA needs JNDI to look up the data source. JNDI is normally available only in an application server. Use JTATransactionManager inside application servers for JTA capabilities.</p>
<p>TransactionDefinition defines the critical transaction attributes such as isolation, propagation, transaction timeout, and the read-only status of a given transaction instance.</p>
<p>Transaction attributes determine the behavior of transaction instances. They can be set programmatically as well as declaratively. Transaction attributes are:</p>
<p>Isolation level: Defines how much a transaction is isolated from (can see) other transactions running in parallel. Valid values are: None, Read committed, Read uncommitted, Repeatable reads, and Serializable. Read committed cannot see dirty reads from other transactions.</p>
<p>Propagation: Determines the transactional scope of a database operation in relation to other operations before, after, and nested inside itself. Valid values are: REQUIRED, REQUIRES_NEW, NESTED, MANDATORY, SUPPORTS, NOT_SUPPORTED, and NEVER.</p>
<p>Timeout: Maximum time period that a transaction can keep running or waiting before it completes. Once at timeout, it will roll back automatically.</p>
<p>Read-only status: You cannot save the data read in this mode.</p>
<p>These transaction attributes are not specific to Spring, but reflect standard transactional concepts. The TransactionDefinition interface specifies these attributes in the Spring Transaction Management context.<br>For multiple DataSource objects or transactional resources, you need a JtaTransactionManager with JTA capabilities, which usually delegates to a container JTA provider.</p>
<p>If you are using Hibernate and just a single DataSource (and no other transactional resource), then the best option is to use HibernateTransactionManager, which requires you to pass the session factory as a dependency.</p>
<p>Spring Transactions supports two transactional modes: proxy mode and AspectJ mode. Proxy is the default and most popular mode. In proxy mode, Spring creates an AOP proxy object, wrapping the transactional beans, and applies transactional behavior transparently around the methods using transaction aspects based on the metadata. The AOP proxy created by Spring based on transactional metadata, with the help of the configured PlatformTransactionManager, performs transactions around the transactional methods.</p>
<p>Spring offers two convenient approaches for declaratively defining the transactional behavior of your beans:</p>
<p>AOP configuration for transactions in an XML metadata file<br>Using the @Transactional annotation</p>
<!-- transactional advices -->
<p>&lt;tx:advice id=”txAdvice” transaction-manager=”transactionManager”&gt;<br> <!-- the transactional semantics... --><br> <a href="tx:attributes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tx:attributes</a><br>   <!-- all methods starting with 'get' are read-only --><br>   &lt;tx:method name=”find*” read-only=”true” /&gt;<br>   <!-- other methods use the default transaction settings (see below) --><br>   &lt;tx:method name=”*” isolation=”DEFAULT” propagation=”REQUIRED” /&gt;<br> <br></p>
<!-- Applying the above advices to the service layer methods -->
<p><a href="aop:config" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aop:config</a><br> &lt;aop:pointcut id=”allServiceMethods”<br> expression=”execution(* com.taskify.service.<em>.</em>(..))” /&gt;<br> &lt;aop:advisor advice-ref=”txAdvice” pointcut- ref=”allServiceMethods” /&gt;<br><br>You can see that this AOP configuration instructs Spring how to weave transactional advices around the methods using pointcuts. It instructs TransactionManager to make all find methods of the entire service layer read-only, and to force other methods to have the transaction propagation: REQUIRED, which means that, if the caller of the method is already in a transactional context, this method joins the same transaction without creating a new one; otherwise, a new transaction is created. If you want to create a different transaction for this method, you should use the REQUIRES_NEW propagation.<br>Also, note that the transaction isolation level is specified as DEFAULT, which means the default isolation of the database is to be used. Most databases default to READ_COMMITTED, which means a transactional thread cannot see the data of other transactions in progress (dirty reads).</p>
<p>Note<br>@Transactional can be applied only to public methods. If you want to annotate over protected, private, or package-visible methods, consider using AspectJ, which uses compile-time aspect weaving. Spring recommends annotating @Transactional only on concrete classes as opposed to interfaces, as it will not work in most cases such as when you use proxy-target-class=”true” or mode=”aspectj”.</p>
<p>You need to first enable transaction management in your application before Spring can detect the @Transactional annotation for your bean methods. You enable transaction in your XML metadata using the following notation:</p>
<p>&lt;tx:annotation-driven transaction-manager=”transactionManager” /&gt;<br>The following is the Java configuration alternative for the preceding listing:</p>
<p>@Configuration<br>@EnableTransactionManagement<br>public class JpaConfiguration {<br>}
Spring scans the application context for bean methods annotated with @Transactional when it sees either of the preceding settings.</p>
<p>Implementing InitializingBean and DisposableBean</p>
<p>The Spring IoC container invokes the callback methods afterPropertiesSet() of org.springframework.beans.factory.InitializingBean and destroy() of org.springframework.beans.factory.DisposableBean on any Spring bean and implements them:</p>
<p>There are different bean scopes in Spring, such as singleton, prototype, request, session, and global session. We will understand each session one by one.</p>
<p>By default, all Spring beans are singleton. Once ApplicationContext is initialized, it looks at all the beans in XML and initializes only one bean per bean definition in Spring Container. On each call to the getBean() method, Spring Container returns the same instance of the bean.</p>
<p>Prototype</p>
<p>The prototype is second bean scope in Spring, which returns a brand-new instance of a bean on each call to the getBean() method. When a bean is defined as a prototype, Spring waits for getBean() to happen and only then does it initialize the prototype. </p>
<p>Spring doesn’t maintain the complete life cycle of the prototype. Here, the container instantiates and configures prototype beans and returns this bean to the client with no further record of this prototype instance.</p>
<p>Request</p>
<p>The third bean scope in Spring is request, which is available only in web applications that use Spring and create an instance of bean for every HTTP request. Here, a new bean is created per Servlet request. Spring will be aware of when a new request is happening because it ties well with the Servlet APIs, and depending on the request, Spring creates a new bean. So, if the reque</p>
<p>Session</p>
<p>The session is the fourth bean scope in Spring, which is available only in web applications that use Spring and create an instance of bean for every HTTP session. Here, a new bean is created per session. As long as there is one user accessing in a single session, each call to getBean() will return same instance of the bean. </p>
<p>Global session</p>
<p>The global session is the fifth bean scope in Spring, which works only in portlet environments that use Spring and create a bean for every new portlet session.</p>
<p>Spring’s BeanFactory manages the life cycle of beans created through the Spring IoC container. The life cycle of beans consist of callback methods, which can be categorized broadly into the following two groups:</p>
<p>Post-initialization callback methods<br>Pre-destruction callback methods</p>
<p>Initialization</p>
<p>It represents a sequence of activities that take place between the bean instantiation and the handover of its reference to the client application:</p>
<p>The bean container finds the definition of the Spring bean in the configuration file and creates an instance of the bean<br>If any properties are mentioned, populate the properties using setters<br>If the Bean class implements the BeanNameAware interface, then call the setBeanName() method<br>If the Bean class implements the BeanFactoryAware interface, then call the setBeanFactory() method<br>If the Bean class implements the ApplicationContextAware interface, then call the setApplicationContext() method<br>If there are any BeanPostProcessors objects associated with the BeanFactory interface that loaded the bean, then Spring will call the postProcessBeforeInitialization() method before the properties for the bean are injected<br>If the Bean class implements the InitializingBean interface, then call the afterPropertiesSet() method once all the bean properties defined in the configuration file are injected<br>If the bean definition in the configuration file contains the init-method attribute, then call this method after resolving the value for the attribute to a method name in the Bean class<br>The postProcessAfterInitialization() method will be called if there are any bean post processors attached to the BeanFactory interface that loads the bean</p>
<p>Destruction</p>
<p>This represents the following sequence of activities:</p>
<p>If the Bean class implements the DisposableBean interface, then call the destroy() method when the application no longer needs the bean reference<br>If the bean definition in the configuration file contains the destroy-method attribute, then call this method after resolving the value for the attribute to a method name in the Bean class.</p>
<p>The InitializingBean interface has afterPropertiesSet(), which needs to be implemented, and it will be called by Spring when this bean is initialized and all properties are set. This InitializingBean interface is a marker for the bean to know that the afterPropertiesSet() method of this bean needs to be called after initialization.</p>
<p>Using init-method in the XML configuration<br>In the case of XML-based configuration metadata, you can use the init-method attribute to specify the name of the method that has a void no-argument signature, which is to be called on the bean immediately upon instantiation.</p>
<p>In the beans.xml file, you’ll find the following code:</p>
<p>…<br><bean id="employeeServiceBean" class="org.packt.Spring.chapter2.callbacks.xml.EmployeeServiceImpl" init-method="myInit"><br></bean><br>…<br>In the EmployeeServiceImpl.java class, you’ll find the following code:</p>
