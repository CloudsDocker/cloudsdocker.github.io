            <h1 id="verbose-gc"><a href="#verbose-gc" class="headerlink" title="verbose:gc"></a>verbose:gc</h1><p><code>verbose:gc</code> prints right after each gc collection and prints details about each generation memory details. Here is blog on how to read verbose gc</p>
<p>If you are trying to look for memory leak, verbose:gc may not be enough. Use some visualization tools like jhat (or) visualvm etc.,</p>

<p>a typical ratio of YoungGen vs. OldGen is 1:3 or 33%.</p>
<p>Minimizing the frequency of major GC collections is a key aspect for optimal performance so it is very important that you understand and estimate how much memory you need during your peak volume.</p>
<p>Again, your type of application and data will dictate how much memory you need. Shopping cart type of applications (long lived objects) involving large and non-serialized session data typically need large Java Heap and lot of OldGen space. Stateless and XML processing heavy applications (lot of short lived objects) require proper YoungGen space in order to minimize frequency of major collections.</p>
<h2 id="Generational-collection"><a href="#Generational-collection" class="headerlink" title="Generational collection"></a>Generational collection</h2><p>According to the generational hypothesis [21], most objects die young and consequently older objects tend to live longer. Generational collection capitalises on the generational hypothesis by dividing the available memory space into multiple regions called generations. Garbage collector passes are less frequent as the generations grow older and objects are always allocated into the newest generation. If the object survives a garbage collection, it is promoted to an older generation. Each generation can have a<br>separate garbage collection strategy.</p>
<h2 id="Reference-counting"><a href="#Reference-counting" class="headerlink" title="Reference counting"></a>Reference counting</h2><p> Reference counting uses a counter per object to record the number of<br>references to the object. The pointer is incremented each time a reference towards the<br>object is created. The object is reclaimed when its reference count drops to zero. Reference<br>counting is being extensively used by scripting languages such as Perl.</p>
<h2 id="GC-strategy"><a href="#GC-strategy" class="headerlink" title="GC strategy"></a>GC strategy</h2><p>Mark-Sweep garbage collection is most times followed by a compaction phase in order to avoid memory fragmentation. The compaction phase requires moving the objects to adjacent memory locations, thus making Mark-Sweep quite an expensive algorithm for large memory multiprocessor environments, unless a multithreaded heap compactor is employed.<br>Simple reference counting is also unsuitable for high throughput environments because it requires objects to be reclaimed on pointer updates; if a pointer is removed and the reference count of the pointed object drops to zero, the runtime system is required to collect both that object and the objects it references. Furthermore, a major drawback of reference counting is its inability to collect circular data structures, such as doubly linked lists. Despite its drawbacks, the simplicity in the implementation of reference counting made it the preferred garbage collection strategy in runtime environments with a limited lifetime, such as scripting languages.</p>
<h2 id="mutable-memory"><a href="#mutable-memory" class="headerlink" title="mutable memory"></a>mutable memory</h2><p>Memory in a typical JVM is organised in a series of mutable (garbage collected) and immutable zones. Class code is usually loaded in immutable space1 and remains there until the JVM is stopped. Also, the code emitted from the JIT compiler is temporarily stored in immutable space. The actual allocations take place in the heap, which is a contiguous memory area.</p>
<p>Apart from the class member values, each object also contains<br>additional data such as a pointer to the respective class methods and flags related to locking and<br>garbage collection. In most virtual machines, object headers take up to 8–12 bytes of additional<br>storage space for each object, and can therefore sadle a program with significant performance<br>and space overhead. A lot of work has been put into compacting the object header [6], which,<br>in some cases, resulted in space savings of up to 20%.</p>
<p>A failure to allocate space for an object triggers a garbage collection cycle. The root set<br>is determined by conservatively scanning the stacks of running or suspended threads and the<br>current values of the processor registers for potential pointers to the heap. Root set acquisition<br>can also be a performance bottleneck in the case when a large number of threads is executed<br>concurrently, though these costs can be amortised using clever co-operation of the garbage<br>collector with the JIT.</p>
<h2 id="JDK-1-5"><a href="#JDK-1-5" class="headerlink" title="JDK 1.5"></a>JDK 1.5</h2><p>Sun’s JVM is an implementation of the 1.5 version of the Java language specification. It features an adaptive optimising JIT compiler, the well-known Hotspot engine, and a choice of three garbage collectors [2, 12]. Sun’s JVM is based upon a generational copying garbage collector that utilises two generations  Figure 1 presents the heap organisation, which is shared among all collectors. Allocations initially occur in the eden space and survivors are promoted to one of the survivor spaces in a copying fashion. Optionally, portions of the heap space can be allocated to individual threads (Thread-Local Heaps (TLHs)), in order to speed up allocations on large-heap multithreaded environments. Objects that reach a certain age threshold, usually measured in minor garbage collection cycles, are copied to the tenured generation where they are left untouched until a major collection occurs. A mark-compact garbage collector is used for the tenured generation.</p>
<h1 id="Tuning-advise"><a href="#Tuning-advise" class="headerlink" title="Tuning advise"></a>Tuning advise</h1><ul>
<li>Unless you have specific hardware constraints, devote as much memory as you can to the virtual machine. A big heap size offers the opportunity for less frequent, albeit more time consuming, full heap collections. In a throughput-oriented environment sacrificing pause times to allow more CPU time for the executed application is often a good compromise. Do not allow the virtual machine to be swapped out to disk, as this is catastrophic for performance. In an application server that only runs a single virtual machine, you could devote about 90% of its available RAM to it and turn off paging, without risking the failure of either the virtual machine or the operating system.</li>
<li>Calculate the memory allocation rate for your application. It is a significant measurement that you should perform by exposing the application to full workload. Its impact varies depending on the underlying hardware. As a rule of thumb, on a multiprocessor machine, each processor could easily generate more than 150MB of garbage per second. High allocation rates can be efficiently dealt with by using parallel collectors or large eden heap sizes.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Committed-heap"><a href="#Committed-heap" class="headerlink" title="Committed heap"></a>Committed heap</h2><p>A MemoryUsage object represents a snapshot of memory usage. Instances of the MemoryUsage class are usually constructed by methods that are used to obtain memory usage information about individual memory pool of the Java virtual machine or the heap or non-heap memory of the Java virtual machine as a whole.<br>A MemoryUsage object contains four values:</p>
<p>init    represents the initial amount of memory (in bytes) that the Java virtual machine requests from the operating system for memory management during startup. The Java virtual machine may request additional memory from the operating system and may also release memory to the system over time. The value of init may be undefined.<br>used    represents the amount of memory currently used (in bytes).<br>committed    represents the amount of memory (in bytes) that is guaranteed to be available for use by the Java virtual machine. The amount of committed memory may change over time (increase or decrease). The Java virtual machine may release memory to the system and committed could be less than init. committed will always be greater than or equal to used.<br>max    represents the maximum amount of memory (in bytes) that can be used for memory management. Its value may be undefined. The maximum amount of memory may change over time if defined. The amount of used and committed memory will always be less than or equal to max if max is defined. A memory allocation may fail if it attempts to increase the used memory such that used &gt; committed even if used &lt;= max would still be true (for example, when the system is low on virtual memory).<br>Below is a picture showing an example of a memory pool:<br>        +———————————————-+<br>        +////////////////           |                  +<br>        +////////////////           |                  +<br>        +———————————————-+</p>

<li>The HotSpot JVM (and other modern JVMs) uses a combination of bytecode interpretation and dynamic compilation. When a class is first loaded, the JVM executes it by interpreting the bytecode. At some point, if a method is run often enough, the dynamic compiler kicks in and converts it to machine code; when compilation completes, it switches from interpretation to direct execution.</li>
<li>Code may also be decompiled (reverting to interpreted execution) and recompiled for various reasons, such as loading a class that invalidates assumptions made by prior compilations, or gathering sufficient profiling data to decide that a code path should be recompiled with different optimizations.</li>
<li>One of the challenges of writing good benchmarks (in any language) is that optimizing compilers are adept at spotting and eliminating dead code—code that has no effect on the outcome. Since benchmarks often don’t compute anything, they are an easy target for the optimizer. Most of the time, it is a good thing when the optimizer prunes dead code from a program, but for a benchmark this is a big problem because then you are measuring less execution than you think.</li>
<li>Many microbenchmarks perform much “better” when run with HotSpot’s -server compiler than with -client, not just because the server compiler can produce more efficient code, but also because it is more adept at optimizing dead code.</li>
<li>Writing effective performance tests requires tricking the optimizer into not optimizing away your benchmark as dead code. This requires every computed result to be used somehow by your program—in a way that does not require synchronization or substantial computation.</li>
<li>We happen to need it to verify the correctness of the algorithm, but <strong>you can ensure that a value is used by printing it out</strong>. However, you should avoid doing I/O while the test is actually running, so as not to distort the run time measurement.</li>
<li>A cheap trick for preventing a calculation from being optimized away without introducing too much overhead is to compute the hashCode of the field of some derived object, compare it to an arbitrary value such as the current value of System. nanoTime, and print a useless and ignorable message if they happen to match:<figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">if</span>(foo.x.hashCode()==System.nanoTime())</span><br><span class="line">	System.out.println(<span class="string">" "</span>);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

</li>
</ul>
<p>The comparison will rarely succeed, and if it does, its only effect will be to insert a harmless space character into the output. (The print method buffers output until println is called, so in the rare case that hashCode and System.nanoTime are equal no I/O is actually performed.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Not only should every computed result be used, but <strong>results should also be unguessable</strong>. Otherwise, a smart dynamic optimizing compiler is allowed to replace actions with precomputed results. </li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Java-GC"><a href="#Java-GC" class="headerlink" title="Java GC"></a>Java GC</h1><p>Java’s GC considers objects “garbage” <strong>if they aren’t reachable through a chain starting at a garbage collection root</strong>, so these objects will be collected. Even though objects may point to each other to form a cycle, they’re <strong>still garbage if they’re cut off from the root</strong>.</p>
<p>See the section on unreachable objects in Appendix A: The Truth About Garbage Collection in Java Platform Performance: Strategies and Tactics (free ebook, also available on Safari) for the gory details.</p>
<h3 id="Java-Garbage-collector-handles-circular-reference"><a href="#Java-Garbage-collector-handles-circular-reference" class="headerlink" title="Java Garbage collector handles circular-reference!"></a>Java Garbage collector handles circular-reference!</h3><p>How?</p>
<p>There are special objects called called <strong>garbage-collection roots (GC roots)</strong>. These are always reachable and so is any object that has them at its own root.</p>
<p>A simple Java application has the following GC roots:</p>
<pre><code>Local variables in the main method
The main thread
Static variables of the main class</code></pre><p>To determine which objects are no longer in use, the JVM intermittently runs what is very aptly called a <strong>mark-and-sweep algorithm</strong>. It works as follows</p>
<pre><code>The algorithm traverses all object references, starting with the GC roots, and marks every object found as alive.
All of the heap memory that is not occupied by marked objects is reclaimed. It is simply marked as free, essentially swept free of unused objects.</code></pre><p>So if any object is not reachable from the GC roots(even if it is self-referenced or cyclic-referenced) it will be subjected to garbage collection.<br>Ofcourse sometimes this may led to memory leak if programmer forgets to dereference an object.</p>
<hr>
<p>The actual answer to this is implementation dependent. The Sun JVM keeps track of some set of root objects (threads and the like), and when it needs to do a garbage collection, traces out which objects are reachable from those and saves them, discarding the rest. It’s actually more complicated than that to allow for some optimizations, but that is the basic principle. This version does not care about circular references: as long as no live object holds a reference to a dead one, it can be GCed.</p>
<p>Other JVMs can use a method known as reference counting. When a reference is created to the object, some counter is incremented, and when the reference goes out of scope, the counter is decremented. If the counter reaches zero, the object is finalized and garbage collected. This version, however, does allow for the possibility of circular references that would never be garbage collected. As a safeguard, many such JVMs include a backup method to determine which objects actually are dead which it runs periodically to resolve self-references and defrag the heap.</p>
<hr>
<p>A garbage collector starts from some “root” set of places that are always considered “reachable”, such as the <strong>CPU registers, stack, and global variables</strong>. It works by finding any pointers in those areas, and <strong>recursively finding everything they point at</strong>. Once it’s found all that, everything else is garbage.</p>
<p>There are, of course, quite a few variations, mostly for the sake of speed. For example, most modern garbage collectors are “generational”, meaning that they divide objects into generations, and as an object gets older, the garbage collector goes longer and longer between times that it tries to figure out whether that object is still valid or not – it just starts to assume that if it has lived a long time, chances are pretty good that it’ll continue to live even longer.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the basic idea remains the same: it’s all based on starting from some root set of things that it takes for granted could still be used, and then chasing all the pointers to find what else could be in use.</p>
<p>Interesting aside: may people are often surprised by the degree of similarity between this part of a garbage collector and code for marshaling objects for things like remote procedure calls. In each case, you’re starting from some root set of objects, and chasing pointers to find all the other objects those refer to…</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="How-Garbage-Collection-Really-Works"><a href="#How-Garbage-Collection-Really-Works" class="headerlink" title="How Garbage Collection Really Works"></a>How Garbage Collection Really Works</h3><p>Many people think garbage collection collects and discards <strong>dead</strong> objects. In reality, Java garbage collection is <strong>doing the opposite</strong>! <strong>Live</strong> objects are <strong>tracked</strong> and everything else designated garbage. As you’ll see, this fundamental misunderstanding can lead to many performance problems.</p>
<h4 id="Garbage-Collection-Roots—The-Source-of-All-Object-Trees"><a href="#Garbage-Collection-Roots—The-Source-of-All-Object-Trees" class="headerlink" title="Garbage-Collection Roots—The Source of All Object Trees"></a>Garbage-Collection Roots—The Source of All Object Trees</h4><p>Every object tree must have one or more root objects. As long as the application can reach those roots, the whole tree is reachable. But when are those root objects considered reachable? Special objects called <strong>garbage-collection roots (GC roots; see Figure 2.2) are always reachable</strong> and so is any object that has a garbage-collection root at its own root.</p>
<p>There are <strong>four</strong> kinds of GC roots in Java:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Local variables</strong> are kept alive by the stack of a thread. This is not a real object virtual reference and thus is not visible. For all intents and purposes, local variables are GC roots.</li>
<li><strong>Active Java threads</strong> are always considered live objects and are therefore GC roots. This is especially important for thread local variables.</li>
<li><strong>Static variables</strong> are referenced by their classes. This fact makes them de facto GC roots. Classes themselves can be garbage-collected, which would remove all referenced static variables. This is of special importance when we use application servers, OSGi containers or class loaders in general. We will discuss the related problems in the Problem Patterns section.</li>
<li><strong>JNI References</strong> are Java objects that the native code has created as part of a JNI call. Objects thus created are treated specially because the JVM does not know if it is being referenced by the native code or not. Such objects represent a very special form of GC root, which we will examine in more detail in the Problem Patterns section below.</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, a simple Java application has the following GC roots:</p>
<ul>
<li>Local variables in the main method</li>
<li>The main thread</li>
<li>Static variables of the main class</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Marking-and-Sweeping-Away-Garbage"><a href="#Marking-and-Sweeping-Away-Garbage" class="headerlink" title="Marking and Sweeping Away Garbage"></a>Marking and Sweeping Away Garbage</h4><p>To determine which objects are no longer in use, the JVM intermittently runs what is very aptly called a <strong>mark-and-sweep algorithm</strong>. As you might intuit, it’s a straightforward, two-step process:</p>
<ol>
<li>The algorithm traverses all object references, <strong>starting with the GC roots</strong>, and <strong>marks every object found as alive</strong>.</li>
<li>All of the heap memory that is <strong>not occupied by marked objects is <em>reclaimed</em></strong>. It is simply marked as free, essentially swept free of unused objects.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
<p>Garbage collectors which rely solely on <strong>reference counting</strong> are generally <strong>vulnerable to failing to collection self-referential structures</strong> such as this. These GCs rely on a count of the number of references to the object in order to calculate whether a given object is reachable.</p>
<p>Non-reference counting approaches apply a more comprehensive reachability test to determine whether an object is eligible to be collected. These systems define an object (or set of objects) which are always assumed to be reachable. Any object for which references are available from this object graph is considered ineligible for collection. Any object not directly accessible from this object is not. Thus, cycles do not end up affecting reachability, and can be collected.</p>

<h3 id="Tracing-collector-vs-countering-collector"><a href="#Tracing-collector-vs-countering-collector" class="headerlink" title="Tracing collector vs. countering collector"></a>Tracing collector vs. countering collector</h3><p>There are two primary types of garbage collectors, although often a hybrid approach is found between these to suit particular needs. The first type, the one which might be the most intuitive, is a reference counting collector. The second one, which is most similar to what we described above, is a tracing collector.</p>
<h4 id="Reference-Counting-Collector"><a href="#Reference-Counting-Collector" class="headerlink" title="Reference Counting Collector"></a>Reference Counting Collector</h4><p>When a new memory object is allocated by the GC, it is given an integer count field. Every time a pointer is made to that object, a reference, the count is increased. So long as the count is a positive non-zero integer, the object is actively being referenced and is still alive.<br>When a reference to the object is removed, the count is decremented. When the count reaches zero, the object is dead and can be immediately reclaimed.<br>There are a number of points to remember about Reference Counting collectors:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Circular references will never be reclaimed</strong>, even if the entire set of objects is dead.</li>
<li><strong>Reference counting is pervasive</strong>: The entire program must be made aware of the system, and every pointer reference or dereference must be accompanied by an appropriate increment or decrement. Failing to maintain the count, even once in a large program, will create memory problems for your program.</li>
<li>Reference counting can be <strong>costly</strong>, because counts must be manipulated for every pointer operation, and the count must be tested against zero on ever decrement. These operations can, if used often enough, create a performance penalty for your program.</li>
</ol>
<p>These types of collectors are often called <strong>cooperative collectors</strong> because they require cooperation from the rest of the system to maintain the counts.</p>
<h4 id="Tracing-Collector"><a href="#Tracing-Collector" class="headerlink" title="Tracing Collector"></a>Tracing Collector</h4><p>Tracing collectors are entirely dissimilar from reference counting collectors, and have opposite strengths and weaknesses.<br>When the Tracing GC allocates a new memory chunk, the GC does not create a counter, but it does create a flag to determine when the item has been marked, and a pointer to the object that the GC keeps. The flags are not manipulated by the program itself, but are only manipulated by the GC when it performs a run.</p>
<p>During a GC run, the program execution typically halts. This can cause intermittent pauses in the program, pauses which can be quite long if there are many memory objects to trace.</p>
<p>The GC selects a set of root objects which are available to the current program scope and parent scopes. Starting from these objects, the GC identifies all pointers within the objects, called children. The object itself is marked as being alive, and then the collector moves to each child and marks it in the same way. The memory objects form a sort of tree structure, and the GC traverses this tree using recursive or stack-based methods.</p>
<p>At the end of the GC run, when there are no more children to be marked, all unmarked objects are considered unreachable and therefore dead. All dead objects are collected.</p>
<p>A few points to remember about Tracing GCs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tracing GCs can be used <strong>to find cycles</strong>, memory objects whose pointers form circular structures. Reference Counting schemes cannot do this.</li>
<li>Tracing GCs <strong>cause pauses</strong> in the program, and these pauses can become unbearably long in some complex programs that use many small memory objects.</li>
<li><strong>Dead objects are not reclaimed immediately</strong>. Reclamation only occurs after a GC run. This causes a certain inefficiency in memory usage.</li>
<li>Tracing collectors do not require the program to account explicitly for memory counts or memory status updates. All memory tracking logic is stored inside the GC itself. This makes it easier to write extensions for these systems, and also makes it easier to install a Tracing GC in an existing system then to install a Reference Counting one.</li>
</ol>
<p>Tracing GCs are often called <strong>uncooperative</strong> collectors because they do not require cooperation from the rest of the system to function properly.<br>Hybrid Collectors</p>
<p>Sometimes, reference counting schemes will utilize Tracing systems to find cyclical garbage. Tracing systems may employ reference counts on very large objects to ensure they are reclaimed quickly. These are just two examples of hybridized garbage collectors that are more common then either of the two “pure” types described above.</p>
<p>In later chapters, we will discuss garbage collectors and their algorithms in more detail.</p>

<h1 id="Java-GC-1"><a href="#Java-GC-1" class="headerlink" title="Java GC"></a>Java GC</h1><p>Java’s GC considers objects “garbage” <strong>if they aren’t reachable through a chain starting at a garbage collection root</strong>, so these objects will be collected. Even though objects may point to each other to form a cycle, they’re <strong>still garbage if they’re cut off from the root</strong>.</p>
<p>See the section on unreachable objects in Appendix A: The Truth About Garbage Collection in Java Platform Performance: Strategies and Tactics (free ebook, also available on Safari) for the gory details.</p>
<h3 id="Java-Garbage-collector-handles-circular-reference-1"><a href="#Java-Garbage-collector-handles-circular-reference-1" class="headerlink" title="Java Garbage collector handles circular-reference!"></a>Java Garbage collector handles circular-reference!</h3><p>How?</p>
<p>There are special objects called called <strong>garbage-collection roots (GC roots)</strong>. These are always reachable and so is any object that has them at its own root.</p>
<p>A simple Java application has the following GC roots:</p>
<pre><code>Local variables in the main method
The main thread
Static variables of the main class</code></pre><p>To determine which objects are no longer in use, the JVM intermittently runs what is very aptly called a <strong>mark-and-sweep algorithm</strong>. It works as follows</p>
<pre><code>The algorithm traverses all object references, starting with the GC roots, and marks every object found as alive.
All of the heap memory that is not occupied by marked objects is reclaimed. It is simply marked as free, essentially swept free of unused objects.</code></pre><p>So if any object is not reachable from the GC roots(even if it is self-referenced or cyclic-referenced) it will be subjected to garbage collection.<br>Ofcourse sometimes this may led to memory leak if programmer forgets to dereference an object.</p>
<hr>
<p>The actual answer to this is implementation dependent. The Sun JVM keeps track of some set of root objects (threads and the like), and when it needs to do a garbage collection, traces out which objects are reachable from those and saves them, discarding the rest. It’s actually more complicated than that to allow for some optimizations, but that is the basic principle. This version does not care about circular references: as long as no live object holds a reference to a dead one, it can be GCed.</p>
<p>Other JVMs can use a method known as reference counting. When a reference is created to the object, some counter is incremented, and when the reference goes out of scope, the counter is decremented. If the counter reaches zero, the object is finalized and garbage collected. This version, however, does allow for the possibility of circular references that would never be garbage collected. As a safeguard, many such JVMs include a backup method to determine which objects actually are dead which it runs periodically to resolve self-references and defrag the heap.</p>
<hr>
<p>A garbage collector starts from some “root” set of places that are always considered “reachable”, such as the <strong>CPU registers, stack, and global variables</strong>. It works by finding any pointers in those areas, and <strong>recursively finding everything they point at</strong>. Once it’s found all that, everything else is garbage.</p>
<p>There are, of course, quite a few variations, mostly for the sake of speed. For example, most modern garbage collectors are “generational”, meaning that they divide objects into generations, and as an object gets older, the garbage collector goes longer and longer between times that it tries to figure out whether that object is still valid or not – it just starts to assume that if it has lived a long time, chances are pretty good that it’ll continue to live even longer.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the basic idea remains the same: it’s all based on starting from some root set of things that it takes for granted could still be used, and then chasing all the pointers to find what else could be in use.</p>
<p>Interesting aside: may people are often surprised by the degree of similarity between this part of a garbage collector and code for marshaling objects for things like remote procedure calls. In each case, you’re starting from some root set of objects, and chasing pointers to find all the other objects those refer to…</p>

<h1 id="to-be-callibrated"><a href="#to-be-callibrated" class="headerlink" title="to be callibrated"></a>to be callibrated</h1><p>G1 is a concurrent collector that operates on discrete regions within the heap. Each region (there are by default around 2,048 of them) can belong to either the old or new generation, and the generational regions need not be contiguous. The idea behind having regions in the old generation is that when the concurrent background threads look for unreferenced objects, some regions will contain more garbage than other regions. The actual collection of a region still requires that application threads be stopped, but G1 can focus on the regions that are mostly garbage and only spend a little bit of time emptying those regions. This approach—clearing out only the mostly garbage regions—is what gives G1 its name: Garbage First.<br>That doesn’t apply to the regions in the young generation: during a young GC, the entire young generation is either freed or promoted (to a survivor space or to the old generation). Still, the young generation is defined in terms of regions, in part because it makes resizing the generations much easier if the regions are predefined.<br>G1 has four main operations:<br>A young collection<br>A background, concurrent cycle<br>A mixed collection<br>If necessary, a full GC<br>We’ll look at each of those in turn, starting with the G1 young collection shown in Figure 6-6.</p>

            <h1 id="What-is-the-difference-between-arbitrage-and-hedging"><a href="#What-is-the-difference-between-arbitrage-and-hedging" class="headerlink" title="What is the difference between arbitrage and hedging?"></a>What is the difference between arbitrage and hedging?</h1><ul>
<li><strong>Hedging</strong> involves the concurrent use of more than one bet in opposite directions <strong>to limit risk</strong> of serious investment loss. </li>
<li><strong>Arbitrage is the practice of trading a price difference between more than one market for the same good in an attempt **to profit</strong> from the <strong>imbalance</strong>. 
These two concepts play important roles in finance, economics and investments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each transaction relies involves two competing types of trades: <strong>betting</strong> short versus betting long (hedging) and *<em>buying versus selling *</em>(arbitrage). Both are used by traders who operate in volatile, dynamic market environments. Other than these two similarities, however, they are very different techniques that are used for very different purposes.</p>
<h2 id="Arbitrage"><a href="#Arbitrage" class="headerlink" title="Arbitrage"></a>Arbitrage</h2><p>Arbitrage involves <strong>both purchase and sale within a very short period of time</strong>. If a good is being sold for $100 in one market and $108 in another market, a savvy trader could purchase the $100 item and then sell it in the other market for $108. The trader enjoys <strong>a risk-free return</strong> of 8% ($8 / $100), minus any transaction or transportation expenses.</p>
<p>With the proliferation of high-speed computing technology and constant price information, arbitrage is much more difficult in financial markets than it used to be. Still, arbitrage opportunities can be found in the forex market, in bonds, in futures markets and sometimes in equities.</p>
<h2 id="Hedging"><a href="#Hedging" class="headerlink" title="Hedging"></a>Hedging</h2><p>Hedging is <strong>not the pursuit of risk-free *<em>trades; instead, it is an attempt to *</em>reduce known risks</strong> while trading. Options contacts, forward contracts, swaps and derivatives are all used by traders to purchase opposite positions in the market. By betting against both upward and downward movement, the hedger can ensure a certain amount of *<em>reduced gain or loss *</em> on a trade.</p>
<p>Hedging can take place almost anywhere, but it has become a particularly important aspect of financial markets, business management and gambling. Much like any other risk/reward trade, hedging results in lower returns for the party involved, but it can offer significant protection against downside risk.</p>

<p>By defining a Scope when searching, you can include/exclude arbitrary files/folders from that scope.<br>Detailed Answer<br>One way to achieve your requirement (excluding files and folders from a search) is to define a custom scope.

<li>Lookup process<ul>
<li>Step# 1: Quickly determine the bucket number in which this element may reside (using key.hashCode()).</li>
<li>Step# 2: Go over the mini-list and return the element that matches the key (using key.equals()).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Immutability of keys</li>
<li>In Node&lt;K,V&gt; node of hashMap, besides key, value, hash, there is Node next link inside. So undelrying table is a linked list.</li>
<li>For <strong>get()</strong>, firstly using hashcode calculation, divide by bucket number and get reminder, to locate the bucket, then compare key via “.euqals()”, if matched, the value will be returned.</li>
<li>Load factor and resize<br>When new hashHap is being populated, the linkedList associated with each bucket of source hashMap is iterated and nodes are copied to the destination bucket. However, note that these new nodes are prepended to the head of the destination linkedList. So resizing has an side effect of reversing the order of the items in the list. Default load factor for hashMap is 0.75.</li>
<li>Worst-case performance:<br>In the worst case, a hashMap reduces to a linkedList.<br>However with Java 8, there is a change,<br>Java 8 intelligently determines if we are running in the worst-case performance scenario and converts the list into a binary search tree.</li>
<li>Collisions<br>Collisions happen when 2 distinct keys generate the same hashCode() value. Multiple collisions are the result of bad hashCode() algorithm.There are many collision-resolution strategies - chaining, double-hashing, clustering.<br>However, java has chosen chaining strategy for hashMap, so in case of collisions, items are chained together just like in a linkedList.</li>
<li>Some specialized hashMaps for specific purposes:</li>
<li><ul>
<li>ConcurrentHashMap: HashMap to be used in multithreaded applications.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>EnumMap: HashMap with Enum values as keys.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><ul>
<li>LinkedHashMap: HashMap with predictable iteration order (great for FIFO/LIFO caches)</li>

<h2 id="WeakReferenceMap-SoftReference-Map-etc"><a href="#WeakReferenceMap-SoftReference-Map-etc" class="headerlink" title="WeakReferenceMap, SoftReference Map etc."></a>WeakReferenceMap, SoftReference Map etc.</h2><p>Weak references (a WeakHashMap) aren’t particularly good for this either, because as the elements in the cache become dereferenced by the application code they will quickly be removed from the cache by the garbage collector. This basically means there will be cache faults often (in other words, the cache lookups will fail).</p>
<p>Soft references can be very handy in situations such as this. Because soft references only exist if the memory is available, they can make very effective use of the space that is available. Unfortunately, although there is a WeakHashMap , there is no java.util.SoftHashMap . Why? I’m not really sure. Thankfully, a little trip back over to Jakarta-Commons-Collections digs up the org.apache.commons.collections.map.ReferenceMap .</p>
<p>SoftReferences are typically used for implementing memory caching. The JVM should try to keep softly referenced objects in memory as long as possible, and when memory is low clear the oldest soft references first. According to the JavaDoc, there are no guarantees though.</p>
<p>WeakReferences is the reference type I use most frequently. It’s typically used when you want weak listeners or if you want to connect additional information to an object (using WeakHashMap for example). Very useful stuff when you want to reduce class coupling. </p>
<p>Phantom references can be used to perform pre-garbage collection actions such as freeing resources. Instead, people usually use the finalize() method for this which is not a good idea. Finalizers have a horrible impact on the performance of the garbage collector and can break data integrity of your application if you’re not very careful since the “finalizer” is invoked in a random thread, at a random time.</p>
<p>In the constructor of a phantom reference, you specify a ReferenceQueue where the phantom references are enqueued once the referenced objects becomes “phantom reachable”. Phantom reachable means unreachable other than through the phantom reference. The initially confusing thing is that although the phantom reference continues to hold the referenced object in a private field (unlike soft or weak references), its getReference() method always returns null. This is so that you cannot make the object strongly reachable again.</p>
<p>From time to time, you can poll the ReferenceQueue and check if there are any new PhantomReferences whose referenced objects have become phantom reachable. In order to be able to to anything useful, one can for example derive a class from java.lang.ref.PhantomReference that references resources that should be freed before garbage collection. The referenced object is only garbage collected once the phantom reference becomes unreachable itself. </p>

<li>on other hand Arrays.deepEquals() method compare recursively if an array contains another array. </li>
<li>Arrays.equals() check is if element is null or not and then calls equals() method, it does not check for Array type. </li>
<li>It’s better to use <strong>Arrays.equals()</strong> to compare <strong>non-nested</strong> Array and Arrays.<strong>deepEquals() to compare nested Array</strong>, as former is faster than later in the case of non-nested Array.</li>

<li><p><strong>brute force</strong> method which compares each element of Array to all other elements and returns true if it founds duplicates. Though this is not an efficient choice it is the one which first comes to mind. complexity on order of O(n^2) not advised in production</p>
</li>
<li><p>Another quick way of checking if a Java array contains duplicates or not is to <strong>convert that array into Set</strong>. Since Set doesn’t allow duplicates size of  the corresponding Set will be smaller than original Array if Array contains duplicates otherwise the size of both Array and Set will be same. </p>

</li>
<li><p>One more way to detect duplication in java array is adding every element of the <strong>array into HashSet</strong> which is a Set implementation. Since the add(Object obj) method of Set returns false if Set already contains an element to be added, it can be used to find out if the array contains duplicates in Java or not.</p>

<p>You can see that we have used the fact that last node will point to null to terminate the recursion. This is called the <strong>base case</strong>. It’s very important to identify a base case while coding a recursive solution, without a base case, your program will never terminate and result in StackOverFlowError.</p>
<h1 id="Iterator"><a href="#Iterator" class="headerlink" title="Iterator"></a>Iterator</h1><ul>
<li>is nothing but a traversing object, made specifically for Collection objects like List and Set. </li>
<li>we have already aware about different kind of traversing methods like for-loop ,while loop,do-while,for each lop etc,they all are  index based traversing but as we know Java is purely object oriented language there is always possible ways of doing things <strong>using objects so Iterator is a way to traverse as well as access the data from the collection</strong>. </li>
</ul>
<h1 id="ListIterator"><a href="#ListIterator" class="headerlink" title="ListIterator"></a>ListIterator</h1><ul>
<li>in Java is an Iterator which allows user to traverse Collection like ArrayList and HashSet in both direction by using method <strong>previous() and next ()</strong>. You can obtain ListIterator from all List implementation <strong>including ArrayList and LinkedList</strong>. ListIterator doesn’t keep current index and its current position is determined by call to next() or previous() based on direction of traversing.<ul>
<li>List collection type also supports ListIterator which has add() method to add elements** in collection while Iterating. </li>

<li>If you implement Comparable interface and override compareTo() method it <strong>must be consistent with equals()</strong> method i.e. for equal object by equals() method compareTo() must return zero. failing to so will affect contract of SortedSet e.g. TreeSet and SortedMap like TreeMap, which uses compareTo() method for checking equality</li>
<li>Remember to use Collections.reverseOrder() comparator for sorting Object in reverse order or descending order, as shown in this example.</li>
<li>Use Generics while implementing Comparator and Comparable interface, that prevents error of accidentally overloading compareTo() and compare() method instead of overriding it because both of these methods accept Object as a parameter. By using Generics and @Override annotation we effectively remove that subtle error.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Comparable-vs-Comparator"><a href="#Comparable-vs-Comparator" class="headerlink" title="Comparable vs Comparator"></a>Comparable vs Comparator</h1><ol>
<li>Comparator in Java is defined in java.util package while Comparable interface in Java is defined in java.lang package, which very much says that Comparator should be used as an utility to sort objects which Comparable should be provided by default</li>
<li>Comparator interface in Java has method public int compare (Object o1, Object o2) which returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as the first argument is less than, equal to, or greater than the second. While Comparable interface has method public int compareTo(Object o) which returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this object is less than, equal to, or greater than the specified object.</li>
<li>If any class implement Comparable interface in Java then collection of that object either List or Array can be sorted automatically by using  Collections.sort() or Arrays.sort() method and object will be sorted based on there natural order defined by CompareTo method.</li>
<li>Objects which implement Comparable in Java  can be used as keys in a SortedMap like TreeMap or elements in a SortedSet  for example TreeSet, without specifying any Comparator.</li>
<li>Generally you should not use difference of integers to decide output of compareTo method as result of *<em>integer subtraction can overflow *</em> but if you are sure that both operands are positive then its one of the quickest way to compare two objects. </li>
<li>Some time you write code to sort object of a class for which you are not the original author, or you don’t have access to code. In these cases you can not implement Comparable and Comparator is only way to sort those objects.</li>
<li>Beware with the fact that How those object will behave if stored in SorteSet or SortedMap like TreeSet and TreeMap. If an object doesn’t implement Comparable than while putting them into SortedMap, always provided corresponding Comparator which can provide sorting logic.</li>
<li>Comparator has a distinct advantage of being self descriptive  for example if you are writing Comparator to compare two Employees based upon there salary than name that comparator as SalaryComparator, on the other hand compareTo()</li>
</ol>
<p>So in Summary if you want to sort objects based on <strong>natural order then use Comparable</strong> in Java and if you want to *<em>sort on some other attribute of object then use Comparator *</em> in Java.</p>

<li>How to Compare String in Java<br>String is immutable in Java and one of the most used value class. For comparing String in Java we should not be worrying because String implements Comparable interface and provides a lexicographic implementation for CompareTo method which compare two strings based on contents of characters or you can say in lexical order. You just need to call String.compareTo(AnotherString) and Java will determine whether specified String is greater than , equal to or less than current object. </li>
<li>Dates are represented by java.util.Date class in Java and like String,  Date also implements Comparable in Java so they will be automatically sorted based on there natural ordering if they got stored in any sorted collection like TreeSet or TreeMap. If you explicitly wants to compare two dates in Java you can call Date.compareTo(AnotherDate) method in Java and it will tell whether specified date is greater than , equal to or less than current String.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Exceptions"><a href="#Exceptions" class="headerlink" title="Exceptions"></a>Exceptions</h1><p>One example where compareTo is not consistent with equals in JDK is BigDecimal class. two BigDecimal number for which compareTo returns zero, equals returns false as clear from following BigDecimal comparison example:</p>
<figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br><span class="line">10</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">BigDecimal bd1 = <span class="keyword">new</span> BigDecimal(<span class="string">"2.0"</span>);</span><br><span class="line">BigDecimal bd2 = <span class="keyword">new</span> BigDecimal(<span class="string">"2.00"</span>);</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">System.out.println(<span class="string">"comparing BigDecimal using equals: "</span> + bd1.equals(bd2));</span><br><span class="line">System.out.println(<span class="string">"comparing BigDecimal using compareTo: "</span> + bd1.compareTo(bd2));</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">Output:</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">comparing BigDecimal using equals: <span class="keyword">false</span></span><br><span class="line">comparing BigDecimal using compareTo: <span class="number">0</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p> How does it affect BigDecimal ? well if you store these two BigDecimal in HashSet you will end up with duplicates (violation of Set Contract) i.e. two elements while if you store them in TreeSet you will end up with just 1 element because HashSet uses equals to check duplicates while TreeSet uses compareTo to check duplicates. That’s why its suggested to keep compareTo consistent with equals method in java.</p>
<ul>
<li>Another important point to note is don’t use subtraction for comparing integral values because result of subtraction can overflow as every int operation in Java is modulo 2^32. use either Integer.compareTo()  or logical operators for comparison. </li>
<li>In summary compareTo should provide natural ordering and compareTo must be consistent with equals() method in Java. </li>

<li>NavigableMap in <strong>Java 6</strong> is an <strong>extension of SortedMap</strong>  like TreeMap which provides convenient navigation method like lowerKey, floorKey, ceilingKey and higherKey. </li>
<li>NavigableMap is added on Java 1.6 and along with these popular navigation method it also provide ways <strong>to create a Sub Map from existing Map</strong> in Java e.g. <strong>headMap whose keys are less than specified key</strong>, <strong>tailMap whose keys are greater than specified key and a subMap which is strictly contains keys which falls between toKey and fromKey</strong>. All of these methods also provides a boolean to include specified key or not. TreeMap and ConcurrentSkipListMap are two concrete implementation of NavigableMap in Java 1.6 API.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="use-NavigableMap"><a href="#use-NavigableMap" class="headerlink" title="use NavigableMap"></a>use NavigableMap</h1><p>How to create subMap from Map using Navigable Map in Java with Example<br>In this Java tutorial we will explore some API methods of NavigableMap to show its functionality. This Java program shows example of lowerKey which returns keys less than specified, floorKey returns key less than or equal to, ceilingKey return greater than or equal to and higherKey which returns keys which are greater than specified key. </p>
<p>This Java example also demonstrate use of headMap(), tailMap() and subMap() method which is used to create Map from an existing Map in Java. headMap returns a Map whose keys are lower than specified keys while tailMap returns Map which contains keys, those are higher than specified. Here is complete code example of How to use NavigableMap in Java.</p>

<p> That’s all on What is NavigableMap in Java and How to use NavigableMap with example. We have seen examples of popular navigation method on TreeMap e.g. floorKey. You can also use similar method like lowerEntry, floorEntry, ceilingEntry and higherEntry to retrieve Entry instead of key. NavigableMap is also a good utility to create subset of a Map in Java.</p>

<li>In earlier version of Java, reflection was very slow, and so serializaing large object graphs (e.g. in client-server RMI applications) was a bit of a performance problem. To handle this situation, the java.io.Externalizable interface was provided, which is like java.io.Serializable but with custom-written mechanisms to perform the marshalling and unmarshalling functions (you need to implement readExternal and writeExternal methods on your class). This gives you the means to get around the reflection performance bottleneck.</li>
<li>In recent versions of Java (1.3 onwards, certainly) the performance of reflection is vastly better than it used to be, and so this is much less of a problem. I suspect you’d be hard-pressed to get a meaningful benefit from Externalizable with a modern JVM.</li>
<li>Also, the built-in Java serialization mechanism isn’t the only one, you can get third-party replacements, such as JBoss Serialization, which is considerably quicker, and is a drop-in replacement for the default.</li>
<li>A big downside of Externalizable is that you have to maintain this logic yourself - if you add, remove or change a field in your class, you have to change your writeExternal/readExternal methods to account for it.</li>
<li>In summary, Externalizable is a relic of the Java 1.1 days. There’s really no need for it any more.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="write-transcient-fields"><a href="#write-transcient-fields" class="headerlink" title="write transcient fields"></a>write transcient fields</h2><ul>

<li>The Thread API also provides <strong>the UncaughtExceptionHandler facility, which lets you detect when a thread dies due to an uncaught exception</strong>. The two approaches are complementary: taken together, they provide defense-in- depth against thread leakage.</li>
<li>When <strong>a thread exits due to an uncaught exception</strong>, the <strong>JVM reports this event to an application-provided UncaughtExceptionHandler</strong> (see Listing 7.24); if no handler exists, the default behavior is to print the stack trace to System.err</li>
<li>In long-running applications, always use uncaught exception handlers for all threads that at least log the exception.</li>
<li>To set an UncaughtExceptionHandler for pool threads, provide a ThreadFac- tory to the ThreadPoolExecutor constructor.</li>
<li>Somewhat confusingly, exceptions thrown from tasks make it to the uncaught exception handler <strong>only for tasks submitted with execute</strong> ; for tasks submitted with submit, any thrown exception, checked or not, is considered to be part of the task’s return status.

<li>If you are using any custom object in Map as key, you need to <strong>override equals() and hashCode() method</strong>, and make sure they <strong>follow their contract</strong>. </li>
<li>On the other hand if you are storing a custom object <strong>in Sorted Collection</strong> e.g. SortedSet or SortedMap, you also need to make sure that your <strong>equals() method is consistent to compareTo() method</strong>, otherwise that collection will not follow there contacts e.g. Set may allow duplicates.</li>

Anyway, you <strong>can not override a private or static method</strong> in Java, if you <strong>create a similar method with same return type and same method arguments in child class</strong> then it will <strong>hide the superclass method</strong>, this is known as <strong>method hiding</strong>.</p>
<p>Similarly, you cannot override a private method in sub class because it’s not accessible there, what you do is create another private method with the same name in the child class. See Can you override a private method in Java or more details</p>
<h1 id="Question-What-do-the-expression-1-0-0-0-will-return-will-it-throw-Exception-any-compile-time-error"><a href="#Question-What-do-the-expression-1-0-0-0-will-return-will-it-throw-Exception-any-compile-time-error" class="headerlink" title="Question: What do the expression 1.0 / 0.0 will return? will it throw Exception? any compile time error?"></a>Question: What do the expression 1.0 / 0.0 will return? will it throw Exception? any compile time error?</h1><p>Answer: This is another tricky question from Double class. Though Java developer knows about the double primitive type and Double class, while doing floating point arithmetic they don’t pay enough attention to Double.INFINITY , NaN, and -0.0<br>and other rules that govern the arithmetic calculations involving them. The simple answer to this question is that it will not throw ArithmeticExcpetion and <strong>return Double.INFINITY</strong>.</p>
<p>Also, note that the comparison <strong>x == Double.NaN always evaluates to false</strong>, even if x itself is a NaN. To test if x is a NaN, one should use the method call Double.isNaN(x) to check if given number is NaN or not. If you know SQL, this is very close to NULL there. </p>
<h1 id="Overloading-vs-Overriding"><a href="#Overloading-vs-Overriding" class="headerlink" title="Overloading vs Overriding"></a>Overloading vs Overriding</h1><ul>
<li>Main difference comes from the fact that method <strong>overloading is resolved during compile time</strong>, while method <strong>overriding is resolved at runtime</strong></li>
<li>Also rules of overriding or overloading a method are different in Java. <ul>
<li>a private, static and final method cannot be overriding in Java but you can still overload them</li>
<li>overriding both name and signature of the method must remain same, but in for overloading method, the signature must be different</li>
<li>call to <strong>overloaded</strong> methods are <strong>resolved using static binding</strong> while the call to <strong>overridden method is resolved using dynamic binding</strong> in Java.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Java programmer to declare method with same name but different behavior. Method overloading and method overriding is based on Polymorphism in Java.</li>
<li>In case of method overloading, method with same name co-exists in <strong>same class</strong> but they must have <strong>different method signature</strong>, while in case of method <strong>overriding</strong>, method with <strong>same name</strong> is declared in <strong>derived class or sub class</strong></li>
<li>If you have <strong>two methods with same name</strong> in one Java class <strong>with different method signature</strong> than its called <strong>overloaded</strong> method in Java. You can also overload constructor in Java</li>
<li>Since <strong>return type is not part of method signature</strong> simply changing return type will result in duplicate method and you will get compile time error in Java.</li>
<li>you can also <strong>overload private and final method</strong> in Java but you <strong>can not override</strong> them</li>
<li>When you <strong>override a method</strong> in Java its signature remains exactly same <strong>including return type</strong>. Rules of override:<ul>
<li>Method signature must be same including return type, number of method parameters, type of parameters <strong>and order of parameters</strong> . Be advised: as of Java 5, you’re allowed to change the return type in the overriding method as long as the new return type is a subtype of the declared return type of the overridden (super class) method</li>
<li>Overriding method <strong>can not throw higher Exception</strong> than original or overridden method. means if original method throws IOException than overriding method can not throw super class of IOException e.g. Exception but it can throw any sub class of IOException or simply does not throw any Exception. This rule only applies to checked Exception in Java, overridden method is free to throw any unchecked Exception. </li>
<li>Overriding method <strong>can not reduce accessibility of overridden method</strong> , means if original or overridden method is public than overriding method <strong>can not make it protected</strong>. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Another important point is that you <strong>can not override static method</strong> in Java because <strong>they are associated with Class</strong> <strong>rather than object</strong> and resolved and <strong>bonded during compile time</strong> and that’s the reason you cannot override main method in Java</li>
<li>From Java 5 onwards you can use annotation in Java to declare overridden method just like we did with @override. ** @override annotation allows compiler** , IDE like NetBeans and Eclipse <strong>to cross verify or check</strong>  if this method is really overrides super class method or not.</li>

<p>In summary, bottom line is static binding is a compile time operation while dynamic binding is a runtime. one uses Type and other uses Object to bind. static, private and final methods and variables are resolved using static binding which makes there execution fast because no time is wasted to find correct method during runtime.</p>

<li><p>power of 2 approach:    further enhance, as if 2 divides some interger n, then (n/2) divides n as well so we’ll times of 2. Please be advised in for loop, should use 2*i&lt;=n, rather than “&lt;n”,   otherwise, 4 will be return as ture mistakely</p>

<li><p>isPrimeSquare approach:       we notice that you really only have to go up to the square root of n,   because if you list out all of the factors of a number,  the square root will always be in the middle Finally, we know 2 is the “oddest” prime - it happens to be the only even prime number. Because of this, we need only check 2 separately, then traverse  odd numbers up to the square root of n.  In the end, our code will resemble this:</p>

<li>From Java 8 onwards difference between abstract class and interface in Java has minimized, now even interface can have implementation in terms of default and static method. BTW, in Java you can still extend just one class but can extend multiple inheritance. Abstract class is used to provide default implementation with just something left to customize, while interface is used heavily in API to define contract of a class.</li>

<li><p>That’s all on 3 ways to swap two variables without using third variable in Java. Its good to know multiple ways of swapping two variables without using temp or third variable to handle any follow-up question. Swapping numbers <strong>using bitwise operator is the fastest</strong> among three, because it <strong>involves bitwise operation</strong>. It’s also great way to show your knowledge of bitwise operator in Java and impress interviewer, which then may ask some question on bitwise operation. A nice trick to drive interview on your expert area.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Bitwise-operator"><a href="#Bitwise-operator" class="headerlink" title="Bitwise operator"></a>Bitwise operator</h1><ul>
<li>“~” inverts a bit pattern; it can be applied to any of the integral types, making every “0” a “1” and every “1” a “0”.</li>
<li>The bitwise &amp; operator performs a bitwise AND operation.</li>
<li>The bitwise ^ operator performs a bitwise exclusive OR operation.</li>
<li>The bitwise | operator performs a bitwise inclusive OR operation.</li>

<li>Algorithm to find if linked list contains loops or cycles. Two pointers, fast and slow is used while iterating over linked list. <strong>Fast pointer moves two nodes</strong> in each iteration, while <strong>slow pointer moves to one node</strong>. If linked list contains loop or cycle than both <strong>fast and slow pointer will meet</strong> at some point during iteration. If they don’t meet and fast or slow will point to null, then linked list is not cyclic and it doesn’t contain any loop. </li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Use two pointers fast and slow</li>
<li>Move fast two nodes and slow one node in each iteration</li>
<li>If fast and slow meet then linked list contains cycle</li>
<li>if fast points to null or fast.next points to null then linked list is not cyclic</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>This algorithm is also known as Floyd’s cycle finding algorithm and popularly <strong>known as tortoise and hare algorithm</strong> to find cycles in linked list. Sample can be found via “LoopInList.java”</li>

<p><strong>Double-checked locking doesn’t work in Java 1.4 or earlier</strong>!
Unfortunately, in Java version 1.4 and earlier, many JVMs contain implementations of the <strong>volatile keyword that allow improper synchronization for double-checked locking</strong>. If you must use a JVM earlier than Java 5, consider other methods of implementing your Singleton.</p>
