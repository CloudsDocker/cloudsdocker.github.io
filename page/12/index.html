Which could increase end to end testing efficiency. Normally dev tend to use sleep or wait to insert some stop during execution. What’s the difference of these two?<br>The difference between browser.sleep() and browser.wait() is that browser.wait() expects a specific value/condition. This wait condition is valid of Protractor or any WebDriver framework.</p>
<p>An Expectation for checking an element is visible and enabled such that you can click it.</p>

            <h1 id="JVM-wram-up"><a href="#JVM-wram-up" class="headerlink" title="JVM wram up"></a>JVM wram up</h1><p>Keeping this in mind, for low-latency applications, we need to cache all classes beforehand – so that they’re available instantly when accessed at runtime.</p>
<p>This process of tuning the JVM is known as warming up.</p>
<h1 id="Escape-Analysis"><a href="#Escape-Analysis" class="headerlink" title="Escape Analysis"></a>Escape Analysis</h1><p>Escape analysis is a technique by which the Java Hotspot Server Compiler can analyze the scope of a new object’s uses and decide whether to allocate it on the Java heap.</p>
<p>Based on escape analysis, an object’s escape state might be one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>GlobalEscape – An object escapes the method and thread. For example, an object stored in a static field, or, stored in a field of an escaped object, or, returned as the result of the current method.</li>
<li>ArgEscape – An object passed as an argument or referenced by an argument but does not globally escape during a call. This state is determined by analyzing the bytecode of called method.</li>
<li>NoEscape – A scalar replaceable object, meaning its allocation could be removed from generated code.</li>
</ul>
<p>After escape analysis, the server compiler eliminates scalar replaceable object allocations and associated locks from generated code. The server compiler also eliminates locks for all non-globally escaping objects. It does not replace a heap allocation with a stack allocation for non-globally escaping objects.</p>
<p>The JIT aggressively inlines methods, removing the overhead of method calls. Methods that can be inlined include static, private or final methods but also public methods if it can be determined that they are not overridden. Because of this, subsequent class loading can invalidate the previously generated code. Because inlining every method everywhere would take time and would generate an unreasonably big binary, the JIT compiler inlines the hot methods first until it reaches a threshold. To determine which methods are hot, the JVM keeps counters to see how many times a method is called and how many loop iterations it has executed. This means that inlining happens only after a steady state has been reached, so you need to repeat the operations a certain number of times before there is enough profiling information available for the JIT compiler to do its job.</p>
<p>Rather than trying to guess what the JIT is doing, you can take a peek at what’s happening by turning on java command line flags: -XX:+PrintCompilation -XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+PrintInlining</p>
<p>Here is what they do:</p>
<pre><code>-XX:+PrintCompilation: logs when JIT compilation happens
-XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions: enables other flags like -XX:+PrintInlining</code></pre><p>GlobalEscape and ArgEscape objects must be allocated on the heap, but for ArgEscape objects it is possible to remove some locking and memory synchronization overhead because these objects are only visible from the calling thread.</p>
<p>The NoEscape objects may be allocated freely, for example on the stack instead of on the heap. In fact, under some circumstances, it is not even necessary to construct an object at all, but instead only the object’s scalar values, such as an int for the object Integer. Synchronization may be removed too, because we know that only this thread will use the objects. For example, if we were to use the somewhat ancient StringBuffer (which as opposed to StringBuilder has synchronized methods), then these synchronizations could safely be removed.</p>
<p>EA is currently only available under the C2 HotSpot Compiler so we have to make sure that we run in -server mode.</p>
<h2 id="Why-It-Matters"><a href="#Why-It-Matters" class="headerlink" title="Why It Matters"></a>Why It Matters</h2><p>In theory, NoEscape objects objects can be allocated on the stack or even in CPU registers using EA,  giving very fast execution.</p>
<p>When we allocate objects on the heap, we start to drain our CPU caches because objects are placed on different addresses on the heap possibly far away from each other. This way we will quickly deplete our L1 CPU cache and performance will decrease. With EA and stack allocation on the other hand, we are using memory that (most likely) is already in the L1 cache anyhow.  So, EA and stack allocation will improve our localization of data. This is good from a performance standpoint.</p>
<p>Obviously, the garbage collects needs to run much less frequently when we are using EA with stack allocation. This is perhaps the biggest performance advantage. Recall that each time the JVM runs a complete heap scan, we take performance out of our CPUs and the CPU caches will quickly deplete. Not to mention if we have virtual memory paged out on our server, whereby GC is devastating for performance.</p>
<p>The most important advantage of EA is not performance though. EA allows us to use local abstractions like Lambdas, Functions, Streams, Iterators etc. without any significant performance penalty so that we can write better and more readable code. Code that describes what we are doing rather than how it is done.</p>
<p>The GC cleans up the heap and not the stack. The stack is cleaned up automatically when methods return to their caller whereby the stack pointer is reset to its former value. So GC will clean up objects that ended up on the stack before EA/C2 compilation could be performed. The actual instances (or rather their corresponding representations) live on the stack, there are no referenced objects on the stack in the context of EA optimizations.</p>
<h1 id="JIT-optimization"><a href="#JIT-optimization" class="headerlink" title="JIT optimization"></a>JIT optimization</h1><p>Some JIT Compilation Techniques</p>
<p>One of the most common JIT compilation techniques used by Java HotSpot VM is inlining, which is the practice of substituting the body of a method into the places where that method is called. Inlining saves the cost of calling the method; no new stack frames need to be created. By default, Java HotSpot VM will try to inline methods that contain less than 35 bytes of JVM bytecode.</p>
<p>Another common optimization that Java HotSpot VM makes is monomorphic dispatch, which relies on the observed fact that, usually, there aren’t paths through a method that cause an object reference to be of one type most of the time but of another type at other times.</p>
<p>You might think that having different types via different code paths would be ruled out by Java’s static typing, but remember that an instance of a subtype is always a valid instance of a supertype (this principle is known as the Liskov substitution principle, after Barbara Liskov). This situation means that there could be two paths into a method—for example, one that passes an instance of a supertype and one that passes an instance of a subtype—which would be legal by the rules of Java’s static typing (and does occur in practice).</p>
<p>In the usual case (the monomorphic case), however, having different, path-dependent types does not happen. So we know the exact method definitions that will be called when methods are called on the passed object, because we don’t need to check which override is actually being used. This means we can eliminate the overhead of doing virtual method lookup, so the JIT compiler can emit optimized machine code that is often faster than an equivalent C++ call (because in the C++ case, the virtual lookup cannot easily be eliminated).<br>The two Java HotSpot VM compiler modes use different techniques for JIT compilation, and they can output very different machine code for the same Java method. Modern Java applications, however, can usually make use of both compilation modes.</p>
<p>Java HotSpot VM uses many other techniques to optimize the code that JIT compilation produces. Loop optimization, type sharpening, dead-code elimination, and intrinsics are just some of the other ways that Java HotSpot VM tries to optimize code as much as it can. Techniques are frequently layered one on top of another, so that once one optimization has been applied, the compiler might be able to see more optimizations that can be performed.</p>
<h1 id="Compilation-Modes"><a href="#Compilation-Modes" class="headerlink" title="Compilation Modes"></a>Compilation Modes</h1><p>Inside Java HotSpot VM, there are actually two separate JIT compiler modes, which are known as C1 and C2. C1 is used for applications where quick startup and rock-solid optimization are required; GUI applications are often good candidates for this compiler. C2, on the other hand, was originally intended for long-running, predominantly server-side applications. Prior to some of the later Java SE 7 releases, these two modes were available using the -client and -server switches, respectively.</p>
<p>The two compiler modes use different techniques for JIT compilation, and they can output very different machine code for the same Java method. Modern Java applications, however, can usually make use of both compilation modes. To take advantage of this fact, starting with some of the later Java SE 7 releases, a new feature called tiered compilation became available. This feature uses the C1 compiler mode at the start to provide better startup performance. Once the application is properly warmed up, the C2 compiler mode takes over to provide more-aggressive optimizations and, usually, better performance. With the arrival of Java SE 8, tiered compilation is now the default behavior.</p>

<h1 id="GC-less-Java"><a href="#GC-less-Java" class="headerlink" title="GC-less Java"></a>GC-less Java</h1><p>Java Development without GC<br>All products developed by Coral Blocks have the very important feature of leaving ZERO garbage behind. Because the latency imposed by the Java Garbage Collector (i.e. GC) is unacceptable for high-performance systems and because it is impossible to turn off the GC, the best option for real-time systems in Java is to not produce any garbage at all so that the GC never kicks in. Imagine a high-performance matching engine operating in the microsecond level, sending and receiving hundreds of thousands messages per second. If at any given time the GC decides to kick in with its 1+ millisecond latencies, the disruption in the system will be huge. Therefore, if you want to develop real-time systems in Java with minimal variance and latency, the best option is to do it right without creating any garbage for the GC. </p>
<h2 id="Warming-up-Checking-the-GC-and-Sampling"><a href="#Warming-up-Checking-the-GC-and-Sampling" class="headerlink" title="Warming up, Checking the GC and Sampling"></a>Warming up, Checking the GC and Sampling</h2><p>The key to make sure your system is not creating any garbage is to warm up your critical path from start to finish a couple of million times and then check for memory allocation another couple of million times. If it is allocating memory linearly as the number of iterations increases, it is most likely creating garbage and you should use the stack trace </p>

            <h1 id="Single-Writer-principle"><a href="#Single-Writer-principle" class="headerlink" title="Single Writer principle"></a>Single Writer principle</h1><p>There is a lot of research in computer science for managing this contention that boils down to 2 basic approaches.  One is to provide mutual exclusion to the contended resource while the mutation takes place; the other is to take an optimistic strategy and swap in the changes if the underlying resource has not changed while you created the new copy.  </p>
<h1 id="Memory-Barier"><a href="#Memory-Barier" class="headerlink" title="Memory Barier"></a>Memory Barier</h1><p>Memory barriers, or fences, are a set of processor instructions used to apply ordering limitations on memory operations. </p>
<p>The keyword volatile prevents this problem because it establishes a happens before relationship between the write to the turn variable and the write to the intentFirst variable. The compiler cannot re-order these write operations and if necessary it must forbid the processor from doing so with a memory barrier.</p>
<p>A memory barrier, also known as a <code>membar</code>, <code>memory fence</code> or fence instruction, is a type of barrier instruction that causes a central processing unit (CPU) or compiler to enforce an ordering constraint on memory operations issued before and after the barrier instruction. This typically means that operations issued prior to the barrier are guaranteed to be performed before operations issued after the barrier.</p>
<p>Memory barriers are necessary because most modern CPUs employ performance optimizations that can result in out-of-order execution. This reordering of memory operations (loads and stores) normally goes unnoticed within a single thread of execution, but can cause unpredictable behaviour in concurrent programs and device drivers unless carefully controlled.</p>
<h1 id="Non-blocking-programing"><a href="#Non-blocking-programing" class="headerlink" title="Non blocking programing"></a>Non blocking programing</h1><p>Implementation<br>With few exceptions, non-blocking algorithms use atomic <code>read-modify-write</code> primitives that the hardware must provide, the most notable of which is compare and swap (CAS).</p>
<h2 id="Compare-And-Swap"><a href="#Compare-And-Swap" class="headerlink" title="Compare And Swap"></a>Compare And Swap</h2><p>It compares the contents of a memory location with a given value and, only if they are the same, modifies the contents of that memory location to a new given value. This is done as a single atomic operation. The atomicity guarantees that the new value is calculated based on up-to-date information; if the value had been updated by another thread in the meantime, the write would fail. The result of the operation must indicate whether it performed the substitution; this can be done either with a simple boolean response (this variant is often called compare-and-set), or by returning the value read from the memory location (not the value written to it).</p>
<p>Here is the pseudo code</p>
<figure class="highlight c++"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function">function <span class="title">cas</span><span class="params">(p : pointer to <span class="keyword">int</span>, old : <span class="keyword">int</span>, <span class="keyword">new</span> : <span class="keyword">int</span>)</span> returns <span class="keyword">bool</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">if</span> *p ≠ old &#123;</span><br><span class="line">        <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="literal">false</span></span><br><span class="line">    &#125;</span><br><span class="line">    *p ← <span class="keyword">new</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="literal">true</span></span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>This operation is used to implement synchronization primitives like semaphores and mutexes, as well as more sophisticated lock-free and wait-free algorithms.</p>
<p>Algorithms built around CAS typically read some key memory location and remember the old value. Based on that old value, they compute some new value. Then they try to swap in the new value using CAS, where the comparison checks for the location still being equal to the old value. If CAS indicates that the attempt has failed, it has to be repeated from the beginning: the location is re-read, a new value is re-computed and the CAS is tried again.</p>
<p>A common workaround is to add extra “tag” or “stamp” bits to the quantity being considered. For example, an algorithm using compare and swap on a pointer might use the low bits of the address to indicate how many times the pointer has been successfully modified. Because of this, the next compare-and-swap will fail, even if the addresses are the same, because the tag bits will not match. This does not completely solve the problem, as the tag bits will eventually wrap around, but helps to avoid it. Some architectures provide a double-word compare and swap, which allows for a larger tag. This is sometimes called ABAʹ since the second A is made slightly different from the first. Such tagged state references are also used in transactional memory.</p>
<h2 id="Priority-Inversion"><a href="#Priority-Inversion" class="headerlink" title="Priority Inversion"></a>Priority Inversion</h2><p>Consider two tasks H and L, of high and low priority respectively, either of which can acquire exclusive use of a shared resource R. If H attempts to acquire R after L has acquired it, then H becomes blocked until L relinquishes the resource. Sharing an exclusive-use resource (R in this case) in a well-designed system typically involves L relinquishing R promptly so that H (a higher priority task) does not stay blocked for excessive periods of time. Despite good design, however, it is possible that a third task M of medium priority (p(L) &lt; p(M) &lt; p(H), where p(x) represents the priority for task (x)) becomes runnable during L’s use of R. At this point, M being higher in priority than L, preempts L, causing L to not be able to relinquish R promptly, in turn causing H—the highest priority process—to be unable to run. This is called priority inversion where a higher priority task is preempted by a lower priority one.</p>
<h2 id="RCU"><a href="#RCU" class="headerlink" title="RCU"></a>RCU</h2><p>In computer science, read-copy-update (RCU) is a synchronization mechanism based on mutual exclusion. It is used when performance of reads is crucial and is an example of space–time tradeoff, enabling fast operations at the cost of more space.</p>
<p>Read-copy-update allows multiple threads to efficiently read from shared memory by deferring updates after pre-existing reads to a later time while simultaneously marking the data, <code>ensuring new readers will read the updated data</code>. This makes all readers proceed as if there were no synchronization involved, hence they will be fast, but also making updates more difficult.</p>

<p> The AtomicIntegerArray, AtomicLongArray, and AtomicReferenceArray classes further extend atomic operation support to arrays of these types. These classes are also notable in providing volatile access semantics for their array elements, which is not supported for ordinary arrays. </p>
<h1 id="Volatile"><a href="#Volatile" class="headerlink" title="Volatile"></a>Volatile</h1><p> The Java volatile keyword is used to mark a Java variable as “being stored in main memory”. More precisely that means, that every read of a volatile variable will be read from the computer’s main memory, and not from the CPU cache, and that every write to a volatile variable will be written to main memory, and not just to the CPU cache. </p>
<h2 id="What’s-wrong-to-volatile"><a href="#What’s-wrong-to-volatile" class="headerlink" title="What’s wrong to volatile?"></a>What’s wrong to volatile?</h2><p>The Java <code>volatile keyword guarantees visibility of changes to variables across threads</code>. This may sound a bit abstract, so let me elaborate.</p>
<p>In a multithreaded application where the threads operate on non-volatile variables, each thread may copy variables from main memory into a CPU cache while working on them, for performance reasons. If your computer contains more than one CPU, each thread may run on a different CPU. That means, that each thread may copy the variables into the CPU cache of different CPUs. </p>
<p>With non-volatile variables there are no guarantees about when the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) reads data from main memory into CPU caches, or writes data from CPU caches to main memory. This can cause several problems.</p>
<h3 id="visibility-problem"><a href="#visibility-problem" class="headerlink" title="visibility problem"></a>visibility problem</h3><p>The problem with threads not seeing the latest value of a variable because it has not yet been written back to main memory by another thread, is called a “visibility” problem. The updates of one thread are not visible to other threads. </p>
<p>The Java volatile Visibility Guarantee</p>
<p>The Java volatile keyword is intended to address variable visibility problems. By declaring the counter variable volatile all writes to the counter variable will be written back to main memory immediately. Also, all reads of the counter variable will be read directly from main memory. </p>
<h3 id="Full-volatile-Visibility-Guarantee"><a href="#Full-volatile-Visibility-Guarantee" class="headerlink" title="Full volatile Visibility Guarantee"></a>Full volatile Visibility Guarantee</h3><p>Actually, the visibility guarantee of Java volatile goes beyond the volatile variable itself. The visibility guarantee is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>If Thread A writes to a volatile variable and Thread B subsequently reads the same volatile variable, then all variables visible to Thread A before writing the volatile variable, will also be visible to Thread B after it has read the volatile variable.
If Thread A reads a volatile variable, then all all variables visible to Thread A when reading the volatile variable will also be re-read from main memory.</code></pre><h3 id="The-Java-volatile-Happens-Before-Guarantee"><a href="#The-Java-volatile-Happens-Before-Guarantee" class="headerlink" title="The Java volatile Happens-Before Guarantee"></a>The Java volatile Happens-Before Guarantee</h3><p>To address the instruction reordering challenge, the Java volatile keyword gives a “happens-before” guarantee, in addition to the visibility guarantee. The happens-before guarantee guarantees that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reads from and writes to other variables cannot be reordered to occur <code>after</code> a write to a volatile variable, if the reads / writes originally occurred <code>before</code> the write to the volatile variable.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reads / writes <code>before a write to a volatile</code> variable are guaranteed to <code>&quot;happen before&quot; the write to the volatile</code> variable. Notice that it is still possible for e.g. reads / writes of other variables located after a write to a volatile to be reordered to occur before that write to the volatile. Just not the other way around. <code>From after to before is allowed, but from before to after is not allowed</code>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Reads from and writes to other variables cannot be reordered to occur <code>before a read</code> of a volatile variable, if the reads / writes originally occurred <code>after the read</code> of the volatile variable. Notice that it is possible for reads of other variables that occur before the read of a volatile variable can be reordered to occur after the read of the volatile. Just not the other way around. <code>From before to after is allowed, but from after to before is not allowed</code>. </p>
</li>
<li><p>In short: ==before write,  after read==.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Limitations-of-volatile"><a href="#Limitations-of-volatile" class="headerlink" title="Limitations of volatile"></a>Limitations of volatile</h2><p>Even if the volatile keyword guarantees that all reads of a volatile variable are read directly from main memory, and all writes to a volatile variable are written directly to main memory, there are still situations where it is not enough to declare a variable volatile</p>
<h2 id="Performance-Considerations-of-volatile"><a href="#Performance-Considerations-of-volatile" class="headerlink" title="Performance Considerations of volatile"></a>Performance Considerations of volatile</h2><p>Reading and writing of volatile variables causes the variable to be read or written to main memory. Reading from and writing to main memory is more expensive than accessing the CPU cache. Accessing volatile variables also prevent instruction reordering which is a normal performance enhancement technique. Thus, you should only use volatile variables when you really need to enforce visibility of variables. </p>

            <h1 id="Ansible-What-Is-It-Good-For"><a href="#Ansible-What-Is-It-Good-For" class="headerlink" title="Ansible: What Is It Good For?"></a>Ansible: What Is It Good For?</h1><p>Ansible is often described as a configuration management tool, and is typically mentioned in the same breath as Chef, Puppet, and Salt. When we talk about configuration management, we are typically talking about writing some kind of state description for our servers, and then using a tool to enforce that the servers are, indeed, in that state: the right packages are installed, configuration files contain the expected values and have the expected permissions, the right services are running, and so on. Like other configuration management tools, Ansible exposes a domain-specific language (DSL) that you use to describe the state of your servers.</p>
<p>These tools also can be used for doing deployment as well. When people talk about deployment, they are usually referring to the process of taking software that was written in-house, generating binaries or static assets (if necessary), copying the required files to the server(s), and then starting up the services. Capistrano and Fabric are two examples of open-source deployment tools. Ansible is a great tool for doing deployment as well as configuration management. Using a single tool for both configuration management and deployment makes life simpler for the folks responsible for operations.</p>
<p>Some people talk about the need for orchestration of deployment. This is where multiple remote servers are involved, and things have to happen in a specific order. For example, you need to bring up the database before bringing up the web servers, or you need to take web servers out of the load balancer one at a time in order to upgrade them without downtime. Ansible’s good at this as well, and is designed from the ground up for performing actions on multiple servers. Ansible has a refreshingly simple model for controlling the order that actions happen in.</p>
<p>Finally, you’ll hear people talk about provisioning new servers. In the context of public clouds such as Amazon EC2, this refers to spinning up a new virtual machine instance. Ansible’s got you covered here, with a number of modules for talking to clouds, including EC2, Azure, Digital Ocean, Google Compute Engine, Linode, and Rackspace, as well as any clouds that support the OpenStack APIs.</p>
<h1 id="Architecture"><a href="#Architecture" class="headerlink" title="Architecture"></a>Architecture</h1><p>As with most configuration management software, Ansible has two types of servers: controlling machines and nodes. First, there is a single controlling machine which is where orchestration begins. Nodes are managed by a controlling machine over SSH. The controlling machine describes the location of nodes through its inventory.</p>
<h2 id="Agentless"><a href="#Agentless" class="headerlink" title="Agentless"></a>Agentless</h2><p>In contrast with popular configuration management software — such as Chef, Puppet, and CFEngine — Ansible uses an agentless architecture.[14] With an agent-based architecture, nodes must have a locally installed daemon that communicates with a controlling machine. With an agentless architecture, nodes are not required to install and run background daemons to connect with a controlling machine. This type of architecture reduces the overhead on the network by preventing the nodes from polling the controlling machine.</p>
<h2 id="Playbook"><a href="#Playbook" class="headerlink" title="Playbook"></a>Playbook</h2><p>Playbooks are Ansible’s configuration, deployment, and orchestration language. They can describe a policy you want your remote systems to enforce, or a set of steps in a general IT process.</p>
<p>I like to think of <code>Ansible playbooks as executable documentation</code>. It’s like the README file that describes the commands you had to type out to deploy your software, except that the instructions will never go out-of-date because they are also the code that gets executed directly.</p>
<p>If Ansible modules are the tools in your workshop, playbooks are your instruction manuals, and your inventory of hosts are your raw material.</p>
<p> In Ansible, a script is called a playbook. A playbook describes which hosts (what Ansible calls remote servers) to configure, and an ordered list of tasks to perform on those hosts.</p>
<p> To execute the playbook using the ansible-playbook command. In the example, the playbook is named webservers.yml, and is executed by typing:</p>
<figure class="highlight bash"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$ ansible-playbook webservers.yml</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Ansible will make SSH connections in parallel to web1, web2, and web3. It will execute the first task on the list on all three hosts simultaneously. In this example, the first task is installing the nginx apt package (since Ubuntu uses the apt package manager), so the task in the playbook would look something like this:</p>
<figure class="highlight yaml"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="attr">- name:</span> <span class="string">install</span> <span class="string">nginx</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">  apt:</span> <span class="string">name=nginx</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Ansible will:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generate a Python script that installs the nginx package.</li>
<li>Copy the script to web1, web2, and web3.</li>
<li>Execute the script on web1, web2, web3.</li>
<li>Wait for the script to complete execution on all hosts.</li>
</ol>
<p>Ansible will then move to the next task in the list, and go through these same four steps. It’s important to note that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ansible runs each task in parallel across all hosts.</li>
<li>Ansible waits until all hosts have completed a task before moving to the next task.</li>
<li>Ansible runs the tasks in the order that you specify them.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Variable"><a href="#Variable" class="headerlink" title="Variable"></a>Variable</h2><p>Variable names should be letters, numbers, and underscores. Variables should always start with a letter.</p>
<p>foo_port is a great variable. foo5 is fine too.<br>foo-port, foo port, foo.port and 12 are not valid variable names.</p>
<p>Defining Variables in Playbooks<br>The simplest way to define variables is to put a vars section in your playbook with the names and values of variables.</p>
<p>Ansible also allows you to put variables into one or more files, using a section called vars_files. </p>
<p>We would replace the vars section with a vars_files that looks like this:</p>
<figure class="highlight yaml"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br><span class="line">6</span><br><span class="line">7</span><br><span class="line">8</span><br><span class="line">9</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="attr">vars_files:</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="bullet"> -</span> <span class="string">nginx.yml</span></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line"><span class="comment">## nginx.yml</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">key_file:</span> <span class="string">/etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.key</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">cert_file:</span> <span class="string">/etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.crt</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">conf_file:</span> <span class="string">/etc/nginx/sites-available/default</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">server_name:</span> <span class="string">localhost</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<h2 id="Registering-Variables"><a href="#Registering-Variables" class="headerlink" title="Registering Variables"></a>Registering Variables</h2><p>Often, you’ll find that you need to set the value of a variable based on the result of a task. To do so, we create a registered variable using the register clause when invoking a module. </p>
<p>In order to use the login variable later, we need to know what type of value to expect. The value of a variable set using the register clause is always a dictionary, but the specific keys of the dictionary are different, depending on the module that was invoked.</p>
<p>ACCESSING DICTIONARY KEYS IN A VARIABLE<br>If a variable contains a dictionary, then you can access the keys of the dictionary using either a dot (.) or a subscript ([]).</p>
<h3 id="facts"><a href="#facts" class="headerlink" title="facts"></a>facts</h3><p>When Ansible gathers facts, it connects to the host and queries the host for all kinds of details about the host: CPU architecture, operating system, IP addresses, memory info, disk info, and more. This information is stored in variables that are called facts, and they behave just like any other variable does.</p>
<p>Here’s a simple playbook that will print out the operating system of each server:</p>
<figure class="highlight yaml"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="attr">- name:</span> <span class="string">print</span> <span class="string">out</span> <span class="string">operating</span> <span class="string">system</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">  hosts:</span> <span class="string">all</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">  gather_facts:</span> <span class="literal">True</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">  tasks:</span></span><br><span class="line"><span class="attr">  - debug:</span> <span class="string">var=ansible_distribution</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Viewing All Facts Associated with a Server<br>Ansible implements fact collecting through the use of a special module called the setup module. You don’t need to call this module in your playbooks because Ansible does that automatically when it gathers facts. However, if you invoke it manually with the ansible command-line tool, like this:</p>
<p>$ ansible server1 -m setup</p>
<h2 id="interactive-mode"><a href="#interactive-mode" class="headerlink" title="interactive mode"></a>interactive mode</h2><p>If Ansible did not succeed, add the -vvvv flag to see more details about the error:</p>
<p>$ ansible testserver -i hosts -m ping -vvvv</p>
<p>We can see that the module succeeded. The “changed”: false part of the output tells us that executing the module did not change the state of the server. The “ping”: “pong” text is output that is specific to the ping module.</p>
<h2 id="Simplifying-with-the-ansible-cfg-File"><a href="#Simplifying-with-the-ansible-cfg-File" class="headerlink" title="Simplifying with the ansible.cfg File"></a>Simplifying with the ansible.cfg File</h2><p>We had to type a lot of text in the inventory file to tell Ansible about our test server. Fortunately, Ansible has a number of ways you can specify these sorts of variables so we don’t have to put them all in one place.</p>
<p>Right now, we’ll use one such mechanism, the ansible.cfg file, to set some defaults so we don’t need to type as much.</p>
<h3 id="WHERE-SHOULD-I-PUT-MY-ANSIBLE-CFG-FILE"><a href="#WHERE-SHOULD-I-PUT-MY-ANSIBLE-CFG-FILE" class="headerlink" title="WHERE SHOULD I PUT MY ANSIBLE.CFG FILE?"></a>WHERE SHOULD I PUT MY ANSIBLE.CFG FILE?</h3><p>Ansible looks for an ansible.cfg file in the following places, in this order:</p>
<p>File specified by the ANSIBLE_CONFIG environment variable</p>
<p>./ansible.cfg (ansible.cfg in the current directory)</p>
<p>~/.ansible.cfg (.ansible.cfg in your home directory)</p>
<p>/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg</p>
<p>I typically put an ansible.cfg in the current directory, alongside my playbooks. That way, I can check it into the same version control repository my playbooks are in.</p>
<h2 id="Run-command-remotely"><a href="#Run-command-remotely" class="headerlink" title="Run command remotely"></a>Run command remotely</h2><p>I like to use the ansible command-line tool to run arbitrary commands on remote machines, like parallel SSH. You can execute arbitrary commands with the command module. When invoking this module, you also need to pass an argument to the module with the -a flag, which is the command to run.</p>
<p>For example, to check the uptime of our server, we can use:</p>
<p>$ ansible testserver -m command -a uptime</p>
<p>The command module is so commonly used that it’s the default module, so we can omit it:</p>
<p>$ ansible testserver -a uptime<br>$ ansible testserver -a “tail /var/log/dmesg”</p>
<h3 id="inventory"><a href="#inventory" class="headerlink" title="inventory"></a>inventory</h3><p>WARNING<br>Although Ansible adds the localhost to your inventory automatically, you have to have at least one other host in your inventory file; otherwise, ansible-playbook will terminate with the error:</p>
<p>ERROR: provided hosts list is empty</p>
<h3 id="property-“Changed”"><a href="#property-“Changed”" class="headerlink" title="property “Changed”"></a>property “Changed”</h3><p>The changed key is present in the return value of all Ansible modules, and Ansible uses it to determine whether a state change has occurred. For the command and shell module, this will always be set to true unless overridden with the changed_when clause</p>

<p>If you want to perform a task on one host with reference to other hosts, use the ‘delegate_to’ keyword on a task. This is ideal for placing nodes in a load balanced pool, or removing them. It is also very useful for controlling outage windows. Be aware that it does not make sense to delegate all tasks, debug, add_host, include, etc always get executed on the controller. Using this with the ‘serial’ keyword to control the number of hosts executing at one time is also a good idea:</p>

<p>Note that you must have passphrase-less SSH keys or an ssh-agent configured for this to work, otherwise rsync will need to ask for a passphrase.</p>

            <p>How Flexbox works — explained with big, colorful, animated gifs</p>
<p>Flexbox promises to save us from the evils of plain CSS (like vertical alignment).</p>
<p>Well, Flexbox does deliver on that goal. But mastering its new mental model can be challenging.</p>
<p>So let’s take an animated look at how Flexbox works, so we can use it to build better layouts.</p>
<p>Flexbox’s underlying principle is to make layouts flexible and intuitive.</p>
<p>To accomplish this, it lets containers decide for themselves how to evenly distribute their children — including their size and the space between them.</p>
<p>This all sounds good in principle. But let’s see what it looks like in practice.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll dive into the 5 most common Flexbox properties. We’ll explore what they do, how you can use them, and what their results will actually look like.</p>
<p>Property #1: Display: Flex<br>Here’s our example webpage:</p>
<p>You have four colored divs of various sizes, held within a grey container div. As of now, each div has defaulted to display: block. Each square thus takes up the full width of its line.</p>
<p>In order to get started with Flexbox, you need to make your container into a flex container. This is as easy as:</p>
<p>#container {<br>  display: flex;<br>}</p>
<p>Not a lot has changed — your divs are displayed inline now, but that’s about it. But behind the scenes, you’ve done something powerful. You gave your squares something called a flex context.</p>
<p>You can now start to position them within that context, with far less difficulty than traditional CSS.</p>
<p>Property #2: Flex Direction<br>A Flexbox container has two axes: a main axis and a cross axis, which default to looking like this:</p>
<p>By default, items are arranged along the main axis, from left to right. This is why your squares defaulted to a horizontal line once you applied display: flex.</p>
<p>Flex-direction, however, let’s you rotate the main axis.</p>
<p>#container {<br>  display: flex;<br>  flex-direction: column;<br>}</p>
<p>There’s an important distinction to make here: flex-direction: column doesn’t align the squares on the cross axis instead of the main axis. It makes the main axis itself go from horizontal to vertical.</p>
<p>There are a couple of other options for flex-direction, as well: row-reverse and column-reverse.</p>
<p>Property #3: Justify Content<br>Justify-content controls how you align items on the main axis.</p>
<p>Here, you’ll dive a bit deeper into the main/cross axis distinction. First, let’s go back to flex-direction: row.</p>
<p>#container {<br>  display: flex;<br>  flex-direction: row;<br>  justify-content: flex-start;<br>}
You have five commands at your disposal to use justify-content:</p>
<p>Flex-start<br>Flex-end<br>Center<br>Space-between<br>Space-around</p>
<p>Space-around and space-between are the least intuitive. Space-between gives equal space between each square, but not between it and the container.</p>
<p>Space-around puts an equal cushion of space on either side of the square — which means the space between the outermost squares and the container is half as much as the space between two squares (each square contributing a non-overlapping equal amount of margin, thus doubling the space).</p>
<p>A final note: remember that justify-content works along the main-axis, and flex-direction switches the main-axis. This will be important as you move to…</p>
<p>Property #4: Align Items<br>If you ‘get’ justify-content, align-items will be a breeze.</p>
<p>As justify-content works along the main axis, align-items applies to the cross axis.</p>
<p>Let’s reset our flex-direction to row, so our axes look the same as the above image.</p>
<p>Then, let’s dive into the align-items commands.</p>
<p>flex-start<br>flex-end<br>center<br>stretch<br>baseline<br>The first three are exactly the same as justify-content, so nothing too fancy here.</p>
<p>The next two are a bit different, however.</p>
<p>You have stretch, in which the items take up the entirety of the cross-axis, and baseline, in which the bottom of the paragraph tags are aligned.</p>
<p>(Note that for align-items: stretch, I had to set the height of the squares to auto. Otherwise the height property would override the stretch.)</p>
<p>For baseline, be aware that if you take away the paragraph tags, it aligns the bottom of the squares instead, like so:</p>
<p>To demonstrate the main and cross axes better, let’s combine justify-content and align-items and see how centering works different for the two flex-direction commands:</p>
<p>With row, the squares are set up along a horizontal main axis. With column, they fall along a vertical main axis.</p>
<p>Even if the squares are centered both vertically and horizontally in both cases, the two are not interchangeable!</p>
<p>Property #5: Align Self<br>Align-self allows you to manually manipulate the alignment of one particular element.</p>
<p>It’s basically overriding align-items for one square. All the properties are the same, though it defaults to auto, in which it follows the align-items of the container.</p>
<p>#container {<br>  align-items: flex-start;<br>}
.square#one {<br>  align-self: center;<br>}
// Only this square will be centered.<br>Let’s see what this looks like. You’ll apply align-self to two squares, and for the rest apply align-items: center and flex-direction: row.</p>
<p>Conclusion<br>Even though we’ve just scratched the surface of Flexbox, these commands should be enough for you to handle most basic alignments — and to vertically align to your heart’s content.</p>

<h2 id="Configuration-management"><a href="#Configuration-management" class="headerlink" title="Configuration management"></a>Configuration management</h2><p>Ansible configurations are simple data descriptions of your infrastructure (both human-readable and machine-parsable) - ensuring everyone on your team will be able to understand the meaning of each configuration task. New team members will be able to quickly dive in and make an impact. Existing team members can get work done faster - freeing up cycles to attend to more critical and strategic work instead of configuration management.</p>
<p>Ansible requires nothing more than a password or SSH key in order to start managing systems and can start managing them without installing any agent software, avoiding the problem of “managing the management” common in many automation systems. There’s no more wondering why configuration management daemons are down, when to upgrade management agents, or when to patch security vulnerabilities in those agents.</p>
<h3 id="GOAL-ORIENTED-NOT-SCRIPTED"><a href="#GOAL-ORIENTED-NOT-SCRIPTED" class="headerlink" title="GOAL-ORIENTED, NOT SCRIPTED"></a>GOAL-ORIENTED, NOT SCRIPTED</h3><p>Ansible features an state-driven resource model that describes the desired state of computer systems and services, not the paths to get them to this state. No matter what state a system is in, Ansible understands how to transform it to the desired state (and also supports a “dry run” mode to preview needed changes). This allows reliable and repeatable IT infrastructure configuration, avoiding the potential failures from scripting and script-based solutions that describe explicit and often irreversible actions rather than the end goal.</p>
<h3 id="SECURE-amp-AGENTLESS"><a href="#SECURE-amp-AGENTLESS" class="headerlink" title="SECURE &amp; AGENTLESS"></a>SECURE &amp; AGENTLESS</h3><p>Ansible relies on the most secure remote configuration management system available as its default transport layer: OpenSSH. OpenSSH is available for a wide variety of platforms, is very lightweight and when security issues in OpenSSH are discovered, they are patched quickly.</p>
<p>Further, Ansible does not require any remote agents. Ansible delivers all modules to remote systems and executes tasks, as needed, to enact the desired configuration. These modules run with user-supplied credentials, including support for sudo and even Kerberos and clean up after themselves when complete. Ansible does not require root login privileges, specific SSH keys, or dedicated users and respects the security model of the system under management.</p>
<p>As a result, Ansible has a very low attack surface area and is quite easy to deploy into new environments.</p>
<h2 id="EFFICIENT-ARCHITECTURE"><a href="#EFFICIENT-ARCHITECTURE" class="headerlink" title="EFFICIENT ARCHITECTURE"></a>EFFICIENT ARCHITECTURE</h2><p>Ansible works by connecting to your nodes and pushing out small programs, called “Ansible modules” to them. These programs are written to be resource models of the desired state of the system. Ansible then executes these modules (over SSH by default), and removes them when finished.</p>
<p>Your library of modules can reside on any machine, and there are no servers, daemons, or databases required. Typically you’ll work with your favorite terminal program, a text editor, and probably a version control system to keep track of changes to your content.</p>
<h1 id="MANAGE-YOUR-INVENTORY-IN-SIMPLE-TEXT-FILES"><a href="#MANAGE-YOUR-INVENTORY-IN-SIMPLE-TEXT-FILES" class="headerlink" title="MANAGE YOUR INVENTORY IN SIMPLE TEXT FILES"></a>MANAGE YOUR INVENTORY IN SIMPLE TEXT FILES</h1><p>By default, Ansible represents what machines it manages using a very simple INI file that puts all of your managed machines in groups of your own choosing.  </p>
<p>To add new machines, there is no additional SSL signing server involved, so there’s never any hassle deciding why a particular machine didn’t get linked up due to obscure NTP or DNS issues.</p>

<h2 id="installation"><a href="#installation" class="headerlink" title="installation"></a>installation</h2><p>Once Ansible is installed, it will not add a database, and there will be no daemons to start or keep running. You only need to install it on one machine (which could easily be a laptop) and it can manage an entire fleet of remote machines from that central point. When Ansible manages remote machines, it does not leave software installed or running on them, so there’s no real question about how to upgrade Ansible when moving to a new version.</p>

<p>You might expect this program to print Set, followed by List and Unknown Collection, but it doesn’t. It prints Unknown Collection three times. Why does this happen? Because the classify method is overloaded, and the choice of which overloading to invoke is made at compile time.”</p>
<p>“the best way to fix the program is to replace all three overloadings of classify with a single method that does an explicit instanceof test:</p>
<figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">static</span> String <span class="title">classify</span><span class="params">(Collection&lt;?&gt; c)</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> c <span class="keyword">instanceof</span> Set  ? <span class="string">"Set"</span> :</span><br><span class="line">           c <span class="keyword">instanceof</span> List ? <span class="string">"List"</span> : <span class="string">"Unknown Collection"</span>;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<p>Because overriding is the norm and overloading is the exception, overriding sets people’s expectations for the behavior of method invocation. As demonstrated by the CollectionClassifier example, overloading can easily confound these expectations. It is bad practice to write code whose behavior is likely to confuse programmers. This is especially true for APIs.”</p>
<p>“Exactly what constitutes a confusing use of overloading is open to some debate. A safe, conservative policy is never to export two overloadings with the same number of parameters. If a method uses varargs, a conservative policy is not to overload it at all,”</p>
<p>“Functional programming is a term that means different things to different people.”<br>“At the heart of functional programming is thinking about your problem domain in terms of immutable values and functions that translate between them.”</p>
<h1 id="Target-typing"><a href="#Target-typing" class="headerlink" title="Target typing"></a>Target typing</h1><p>“What is implicit in all these examples is that a lambda expression’s type is context dependent. It gets inferred by the compiler. This target typing isn’t entirely new, either.”</p>
<p>“This restriction is relaxed a bit in Java 8. It’s possible to refer to variables that aren’t final; however, they still have to be effectively final. Although you haven’t declared the variable(s) as final, you still cannot use them as nonfinal variable(s) if they are to be used in lambda expressions. If you do use them as nonfinal variables, then the compiler will show an error.”</p>
<h1 id="Functional-interface"><a href="#Functional-interface" class="headerlink" title="Functional interface"></a>Functional interface</h1><p>“A functional interface is an interface with a single abstract method that is used as the type of a lambda expression.”</p>
