<li>The easiest way to improve search efficiency on a set of data is to put it in a data structure that allows more efficient searching.<br>What data structures can be searched more efficiency than O(n)? Binary tree can be searched in O(log(n)). Arrays and hash tables both have constant time element look up (has tables have worse-case lookup of O(n) but the average case is O(1)).</li>
<li>Then need to determine which data structure to be used. If the underlying characters are just ASCII, then a array[128] would be enough. But characters are UNICODe, then it need 100,000 (100K) array, which is a concern of memory, so hash table would be a better option, which only keep exist characters.<br>In general, arrays are a better choice for long strings with a limited set of possible characters values, hash tables are more efficient for shorter strings or when there are many possible character values.  </li>
<li>For some problems, obvious iterative alternatives like the one just shown don’t exist, but it’s always possible to implement a recursive algorithm without using recursive calls.</li>
<li>For a simple recursive function like factorial, many computer architectures spend more time on call overhead than on the actual calculation. Iterative functions, which use looping constructs instead of recursive function calls, do not suffer from this overhead and are frequently more efficient.</li>
<li>NOTE Iterative solutions are usually more efficient than recursive solutions.</li>
<li>NOTE Every recursive case must eventually lead to a base case.</li>
<li>NOTE Recursive algorithms have two cases: recursive cases and base cases</li>

<li>It is also considered poor taste to include constant factors and lower-order terms in the big-Oh notation. For example, it is not fashionable to say that the function 2n2 is O(4n2 + 6n log n), although this is completely correct. We should strive instead to describe the function in the big-Oh <strong>in simplest terms</strong>.</li>
<li>So, for example, we would say that an algorithm that runs in worst-case time 4n2 + n log n is a quadratic-time algorithm, since it runs in O(n2) time. Likewise, an algorithm running in time at most 5n + 20logn + 4 would be called a linear-time algorithm.</li>

<li>Just as the big-Oh notation provides an asymptotic way of saying that a function is “less than or equal to” another function, the following notations provide <strong>an asymptotic way</strong> of saying that a function grows at a rate that is “<strong>greater than or equal to</strong>” that of another.</li>

<li>Suppose two algorithms solving the same problem are available: an algorithm A, which has a running time of O(n), and an algorithm B, which has a running time of O(n2). Which algorithm is better? We know that n is O(n2), which implies that algorithm A <strong>is asymptotically better</strong> than algorithm B, although for a small value of n, B may have a lower running time than A.</li>

<li>First, note that the use of the big-Oh and related notations can be somewhat misleading should the constant factors they “hide” be very large. For example, while it is true that the function 10100n is O(n), if this is the running time of an algorithm being compared to one whose running time is 10n log n, we should prefer the O(nlog n)-time algorithm, even though the linear-time algorithm is asymptotically faster. This preference is because the constant factor, 10100, which is called “one googol,” is believed by many astronomers to be an upper bound on the number of atoms in the observable universe. So we are unlikely to ever have a real-world problem that has this number as its input size.</li>

<li>To see how fast the function 2n grows, consider the famous story about the inventor of the game of chess. He asked only that his king pay him 1 grain of rice for the first square on the board, 2 grains for the second, 4 grains for the third, 8 for the fourth, and so on. The number of grains in the 64th square would be<br>263 = 9, 223, 372, 036, 854, 775, 808,<br>which is about nine billion billions!</li>
<li>If we must draw a line between efficient and inefficient algorithms, therefore, it is natural to make this distinction be that between those algorithms running in <strong>polynomial [,p?l?’n??m??l] time</strong> and those running in <strong>exponential time</strong>. That is, make the distinction between algorithms with a running time that is <strong>O(nc)</strong> (power c based on n), for some constant c &gt; 1, and those with a running time that is <strong>O(bn)</strong> (power n based on b), for some constant b &gt; 1. Like so many notions we have discussed in this section, this too should be taken with a “grain of salt,” for an algorithm running in O(n100) time should probably not be considered “efficient.” Even so, the distinction between polynomial-time and exponential-time algorithms is considered a robust measure of tractability.</li>

<li>All of the primitive operations, originally described on page 154, are assumed to run in constant time; Assume that variable A is an array of n elements. The expression A.length in Java is evaluated in constant time, because arrays are represented internally with an explicit variable that records the length of the array. Another central behavior of arrays is that for any valid index j, the individual element, A[j], can be accessed in constant time. This is because an array uses a consecutive block of memory. The jth element can be found, not by iterating through the array one element at a time, but by validating the index, and using it as an offset from the beginning of the array in determining the appropriate memory address. Therefore, we say that the expression A[j] is evaluated in O(1) time for an array.</li>

Once the data is sorted, the subsequent loop runs in O(n) time, and so the entire unique2 algorithm runs in O(n log n) time.

            <h1 id="Concepting"><a href="#Concepting" class="headerlink" title="Concepting"></a>Concepting</h1><p>Cloud computing is the on-demand delivery of IT resources and applications via the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing. Whether you run applications that share photos to millions of mobile users or deliver services that support the critical operations of your business, the cloud provides rapid access to flexible and low-cost IT resources.</p>
<p>In its simplest form, cloud computing <code>provides an easy way to access servers, storage</code>, databases, and a broad set of application services <code>over the Internet</code>.</p>
<h1 id="Benefits-of-AWS"><a href="#Benefits-of-AWS" class="headerlink" title="Benefits of AWS"></a>Benefits of AWS</h1><p>There are six advantages for AWS clouding</p>
<ol>
<li>Global in minutes</li>
<li>Variable vs capital expense</li>
<li>Economies of scale</li>
<li>Stop guessing capacity</li>
<li>Focus on business differentaiors</li>
<li>Increate speed and agility </li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Cost-saving"><a href="#Cost-saving" class="headerlink" title="Cost saving"></a>Cost saving</h2><p>One of the key benefits of cloud computing is the opportunity to <code>replace up-front capital infrastructure expenses with low variable costs</code> that scale with your business. With the cloud, businesses no longer need to plan for and procure servers and other IT infrastructure weeks or months in advance. Instead, they can instantly spin up hundres or thousands of servers in minutes and deliver results faster.</p>
<p>With pay-per-use billing, AWS clouding services <code>become an operational expense instead of a capital expense</code>.</p>
<h1 id="Metadata"><a href="#Metadata" class="headerlink" title="Metadata"></a>Metadata</h1><p>Metadata, known as tags, that you can create and assign to your Amazon EC2 resources</p>
<p>Amazon Web Services. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Kindle Location 152). Amazon Web Services. Kindle Edition. </p>
<h1 id="AZ-Available-Zones"><a href="#AZ-Available-Zones" class="headerlink" title="AZ (Available Zones)"></a>AZ (Available Zones)</h1><ul>
<li>Each availability zone is a physical data center in the region, but separate from the other ones (so that they’re isolated from disasters)</li>
<li>AWS Consoles are region scoped (except IAM, S3 &amp; Route53)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="EC2"><a href="#EC2" class="headerlink" title="EC2"></a>EC2</h1><p>Here you need to create an AMI, but because AMI are bounded in the regions they are created, they need to be copied across regions for disaster recovery purposes</p>
<h2 id="Placement-group"><a href="#Placement-group" class="headerlink" title="Placement group"></a>Placement group</h2><p> Placements groups are the answer here, where “cluster” guarantees high network performance (correct answer), whereas “spread” would guarantee independent failures between instances.</p>
<p> When you launch a new EC2 instance, the EC2 service attempts to place the instance in such a way that all of your instances are spread out across underlying hardware to minimize correlated failures. You can use placement groups to influence the placement of a group of interdependent instances to meet the needs of your workload. Depending on the type of workload, you can create a placement group using one of the following placement strategies:</p>
<p> Cluster – packs instances close together inside an Availability Zone. This strategy enables workloads to achieve the low-latency network performance necessary for tightly-coupled node-to-node communication that is typical of HPC applications.</p>
<p> Partition – spreads your instances across logical partitions such that groups of instances in one partition do not share the underlying hardware with groups of instances in different partitions. This strategy is typically used by large distributed and replicated workloads, such as Hadoop, Cassandra, and Kafka.</p>
<p> Spread – strictly places a small group of instances across distinct underlying hardware to reduce correlated failures.</p>
<p> There is no charge for creating a placement group.</p>
<h2 id="Security-Group"><a href="#Security-Group" class="headerlink" title="Security Group"></a>Security Group</h2><p>When you create a security group, it has no inbound rules. Therefore, no inbound traffic originating from another host to your instance is allowed until you add inbound rules to the security group. By default, a security group includes an outbound rule that allows all outbound traffic. You can remove the rule and add outbound rules that allow specific outbound traffic only. If your security group has no outbound rules, no outbound traffic originating from your instance is allowed.</p>
<p>Options 1 and 4 are both incorrect because any changes to the Security Groups or Network Access Control Lists are applied immediately and not after 60 minutes or after the instance reboot.</p>
<p>Option 2 is incorrect because the scenario says that VPC is using a default configuration. Since by default, Network ACL allows all inbound and outbound IPv4 traffic, then there is no point of explicitly allowing the port in the Network ACL. Security Groups, on the other hand, does not allow incoming traffic by default, unlike Network ACL.</p>
<h3 id="Custom-port"><a href="#Custom-port" class="headerlink" title="Custom port"></a>Custom port</h3><p>To allow the custom port, you have to change the Inbound Rules in your Security Group to allow traffic coming from the mobile devices. Security Groups usually control the list of ports that are allowed to be used by your EC2 instances and the NACLs control which network or list of IP addresses can connect to your whole VPC.</p>
<h3 id="Cluster"><a href="#Cluster" class="headerlink" title="Cluster"></a>Cluster</h3><p> Cluster Placement Groups</p>
<p>A cluster placement group is a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone. A placement group can span peered VPCs in the same Region. The chief benefit of a cluster placement group, in addition to a 10 Gbps flow limit, is the non-blocking, non-oversubscribed, fully bi-sectional nature of the connectivity. In other words, all nodes within the placement group can talk to all other nodes within the placement group at the full line rate of 10 Gbps flows and 100 Gbps aggregate without any slowing due to over-subscription.</p>
<h2 id="ASG"><a href="#ASG" class="headerlink" title="ASG"></a>ASG</h2><h3 id="ASG-Lauch-configuration"><a href="#ASG-Lauch-configuration" class="headerlink" title="ASG Lauch configuration"></a>ASG Lauch configuration</h3><p>Launch configurations are immutable meaning they cannot be updated. You have to create a new launch configuration, attach it to the ASG and then terminate old instances / launch new instances</p>
<h3 id="ASG-termination"><a href="#ASG-termination" class="headerlink" title="ASG termination"></a>ASG termination</h3><p>AZs will be balanced first, then the instance with the oldest launch configuration within that AZ will be terminated. For a reference to the default termination policy logic, have a look at this link: <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-instance-termination.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/ec2/userguide/as-instance-termination.html</a></p>
<h2 id="AMI"><a href="#AMI" class="headerlink" title="AMI"></a>AMI</h2><p>the EC2 instances you are currently using depends on a pre-built AMI. This AMI is not accessible to another region hence,  you have to copy it to the us-west-2 region to properly establish your disaster recovery instance.</p>
<p>You can copy an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) within or across an AWS region using the AWS Management Console, the AWS command line tools or SDKs, or the Amazon EC2 API, all of which support the CopyImage action. You can copy both Amazon EBS-backed AMIs and instance store-backed AMIs. You can copy encrypted AMIs and AMIs with encrypted snapshots</p>
<h1 id="AWS-Device-Farm"><a href="#AWS-Device-Farm" class="headerlink" title="AWS Device Farm"></a>AWS Device Farm</h1><p>AWS Device Farm is an app testing service that lets you test and interact with your Android, iOS, and web apps on many devices at once, or reproduce issues on a device in real time.</p>
<h1 id="IAM"><a href="#IAM" class="headerlink" title="IAM"></a>IAM</h1><p>Your whole AWS security is there:<br>• Users<br>• Groups<br>• Roles</p>
<p>Policies are written in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)</p>
<p>IAM has a <code>global</code> view</p>
<p>Permissions let you specify access to AWS resources. Permissions are granted to IAM entities (users, groups, and roles) and by default these entities start with no permissions. In other words, IAM entities can do nothing in AWS until you grant them your desired permissions. To give entities permissions, you can attach a policy that specifies the type of access, the actions that can be performed, and the resources on which the actions can be performed. In addition, you can specify any conditions that must be set for access to be allowed or denied.</p>
<h2 id="To-enforce-IAM"><a href="#To-enforce-IAM" class="headerlink" title="To enforce IAM"></a>To enforce IAM</h2><ul>
<li>Enable Multi-Factor Authentication</li>
<li>Assign an IAM role to the Amazon EC2 instance</li>
</ul>
<p>Always remember that you should associate IAM roles to EC2 instances and not an IAM user, for the purpose of accessing other AWS services. IAM roles are designed so that your applications can securely make API requests from your instances, without requiring you to manage the security credentials that the applications use. Instead of creating and distributing your AWS credentials, you can delegate permission to make API requests using IAM roles.</p>
<h2 id="IAM-policies"><a href="#IAM-policies" class="headerlink" title="IAM policies"></a>IAM policies</h2><p>A permissions policy describes who has access to what. Policies attached to an IAM identity are identity-based policies (IAM policies) and policies attached to a resource are resource-based policies. Amazon RDS supports only identity-based policies (IAM policies).</p>
<h2 id="DB-authenticatioin-via-IAM"><a href="#DB-authenticatioin-via-IAM" class="headerlink" title="DB authenticatioin via IAM"></a>DB authenticatioin via IAM</h2><p>MySQL and PostgreSQL both support IAM database authentication.</p>
<p>To protect the confidential data of your customers, you have to ensure that your RDS database can only be accessed using the profile credentials specific to your EC2 instances via an authentication token.   </p>
<p>You can authenticate to your DB instance using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) database authentication. IAM database authentication works with MySQL and PostgreSQL. With this authentication method, you don’t need to use a password when you connect to a DB instance. Instead, you use an authentication token.</p>
<p>An authentication token is a unique string of characters that Amazon RDS generates on request. Authentication tokens are generated using AWS Signature Version 4. Each token has a lifetime of 15 minutes. You don’t need to store user credentials in the database, because authentication is managed externally using IAM. You can also still use standard database authentication.</p>
<h2 id="IAM-Federation"><a href="#IAM-Federation" class="headerlink" title="IAM Federation"></a>IAM Federation</h2><p>• Big enterprises usually integrate their own repository of users with IAM<br>• This way, one can login into AWS using their company credentials<br>• Identity Federation uses the SAML standard (Active Directory)</p>
<p>• One IAM User per PHYSICAL PERSON<br>• One IAM Role per Application</p>
<h2 id="STS"><a href="#STS" class="headerlink" title="STS"></a>STS</h2><p>Temporary Security Credentials<br>You can use the AWS Security Token Service (AWS STS) to create and provide trusted users with temporary security credentials that can control access to your AWS resources. Temporary security credentials work almost identically to the long-term access key credentials that your IAM users can use, with the following differences:</p>
<p>Temporary security credentials are short-term, as the name implies. They can be configured to last for anywhere from a few minutes to several hours. After the credentials expire, AWS no longer recognizes them or allows any kind of access from API requests made with them.</p>
<p>Temporary security credentials are not stored with the user but are generated dynamically and provided to the user when requested. When (or even before) the temporary security credentials expire, the user can request new credentials, as long as the user requesting them still has permissions to do so.</p>
<h3 id="Amazon-Cognito"><a href="#Amazon-Cognito" class="headerlink" title="Amazon Cognito"></a>Amazon Cognito</h3><p>This service is primarily used for user authentication and not for providing access to your AWS resources. A JSON Web Token (JWT) is meant to be used for user authentication and session management.</p>
<h3 id="AWS-SSO"><a href="#AWS-SSO" class="headerlink" title="AWS SSO"></a>AWS SSO</h3><p>This service uses STS, it does not issue short-lived credentials by itself. AWS Single Sign-On (SSO) is a cloud SSO service that makes it easy to centrally manage SSO access to multiple AWS accounts and business applications.</p>
<h1 id="Storage"><a href="#Storage" class="headerlink" title="Storage"></a>Storage</h1><h3 id="Performance"><a href="#Performance" class="headerlink" title="Performance"></a>Performance</h3><p>Instance Store will have the highest disk performance but comes with the storage being wiped if the instance is terminated, which is acceptable in this case. EBS volumes would provide good performance as far as disk goes, but not as good as Instance Store. EBS data survives instance termination or reboots. EFS is a network drive, and finally S3 cannot be mounted as a local disk (natively).</p>
<p>Need to define two terms:<br>• RPO: Recovery Point Objective<br>• RTO: Recovery Time Objective</p>
<h2 id="S3"><a href="#S3" class="headerlink" title="S3"></a>S3</h2><p>Generating S3 pre-signed URLs would bypass CloudFront, therefore we should use CloudFront signed URL. To generate that URL we must code, and Lambda is the perfect tool for running that code on the fly. </p>
<p>As the file is greater than 5GB in size, you must use Multi Part upload to upload that file to S3.</p>
<h3 id="S3-Select"><a href="#S3-Select" class="headerlink" title="S3 Select"></a>S3 Select</h3><p>It is an Amazon S3 feature that makes it easy to retrieve specific data from the contents of an object using simple SQL expressions without having to retrieve the entire object.<br>Similiarly, Amazon Redshift Spectrum is a feature of Amazon Redshift that enables you to run queries against exabytes of unstructured data in Amazon S3 with no loading or ETL required.</p>
<h3 id="OAI"><a href="#OAI" class="headerlink" title="OAI"></a>OAI</h3><p>Don’t make the S3 bucket public. You cannot attach IAM roles to the CloudFront distribution. S3 buckets don’t have security groups. Here you need to use an OAI. Read more here: <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.html</a></p>
<p>Restricting Access to Amazon S3 Content by Using an Origin Access Identity<br>To restrict access to content that you serve from Amazon S3 buckets, you create CloudFront signed URLs or signed cookies to limit access to files in your Amazon S3 bucket, and then you create a special CloudFront user called an origin access identity (OAI) and associate it with your distribution. Then you configure permissions so that CloudFront can use the OAI to access and serve files to your users, but users can’t use a direct URL to the S3 bucket to access a file there. Taking these steps help you maintain secure access to the files that you serve through CloudFront.</p>
<p>In general, if you’re using an Amazon S3 bucket as the origin for a CloudFront distribution, you can either allow everyone to have access to the files there, or you can restrict access. If you limit access by using, for example, CloudFront signed URLs or signed cookies, you also won’t want people to be able to view files by simply using the direct URL for the file. Instead, you want them to only access the files by using the CloudFront URL, so your protections work. For more information about using signed URLs and signed cookies, see Serving Private Content with Signed URLs and Signed Cookies</p>
<h3 id="Encryption"><a href="#Encryption" class="headerlink" title="Encryption"></a>Encryption</h3><p>With SSE-C, your company can still provide the encryption key but let AWS do the encryption</p>
<h2 id="EBS-Elastic-Block-Storage"><a href="#EBS-Elastic-Block-Storage" class="headerlink" title="EBS (Elastic Block Storage)"></a>EBS (Elastic Block Storage)</h2><p>EBS is already redundant storage (replicated within an AZ)<br>But what if you want to increase IOPS to say 100 000 IOPS?</p>

<h3 id="EBS-types"><a href="#EBS-types" class="headerlink" title="EBS types"></a>EBS types</h3><p> keeping as io1 but reducing the iops may interfere with the burst of performance we need. The EC2 instance type changes won’t affect the 90% of the costs that are incurred to us. CloudFormation is a free service to use. Therefore, gp2 is the right choice, allowing us to save on cost while keeping a burst in performance when needed</p>
<p>You can now choose between three Amazon EBS volume types to best meet the needs of your workloads: General Purpose (SSD), Provisioned IOPS (SSD), and Magnetic volumes. </p>
<h4 id="General-Purpose-SSD"><a href="#General-Purpose-SSD" class="headerlink" title="General Purpose (SSD)"></a>General Purpose (SSD)</h4><p>GP2 volumes are suitable for a broad range of workloads, including small to medium-sized databases, development and test environments, and boot volumes. </p>
<h4 id="Provisioned-IOPS-SSD"><a href="#Provisioned-IOPS-SSD" class="headerlink" title="Provisioned IOPS (SSD)"></a>Provisioned IOPS (SSD)</h4><p>Such volumes offer storage with consistent and low-latency performance, are designed for I/O-intensive applications such as large relational or NoSQL databases, and allow you to choose the level of performance you need. </p>
<h4 id="Magnetic-volumes"><a href="#Magnetic-volumes" class="headerlink" title="Magnetic volumes"></a>Magnetic volumes</h4><p>formerly known as Standard volumes, provide the lowest cost per gigabyte of all Amazon EBS volume types and are ideal for workloads where data is accessed infrequently and applications where the lowest storage cost is important.</p>
<p>Backed by Solid-State Drives (SSDs), General Purpose (SSD) volumes provide the ability to burst to 3,000 IOPS per volume, independent of volume size, to meet the performance needs of most applications and also deliver a consistent baseline of 3 IOPS/GB. General Purpose (SSD) volumes offer the same five nines of availability and durable snapshot capabilities as other volume types. Pricing and performance for General Purpose (SSD) volumes are simple and predictable. You pay for each GB of storage you provision, and there are no additional charges for I/O performed on a volume. Prices start as low as $0.10/GB.</p>
<h4 id="EBS-snapshot"><a href="#EBS-snapshot" class="headerlink" title="EBS snapshot"></a>EBS snapshot</h4><p>While it is completing, an in-progress snapshot is not affected by ongoing reads and writes to the volume.</p>
<p>You can take a snapshot of an attached volume that is in use. However, snapshots only capture data that has been written to your Amazon EBS volume at the time the snapshot command is issued. This might exclude any data that has been cached by any applications or the operating system. If you can pause any file writes to the volume long enough to take a snapshot, your snapshot should be complete. However, if you can’t pause all file writes to the volume, you should unmount the volume from within the instance, issue the snapshot command, and then remount the volume to ensure a consistent and complete snapshot. You can remount and use your volume while the snapshot status is pending.</p>
<h4 id="Save-network-cost"><a href="#Save-network-cost" class="headerlink" title="Save network cost"></a>Save network cost</h4><p> S3 would imply changing the application code, Glacier is not applicable as the files are frequently requested, Storage Gateway isn’t for distributing files to end users. CloudFront is the right answer, because we can put it in front of our ASG and leverage a Global Caching feature that will help us distribute the content reliably with dramatically reduced costs (the ASG won’t need to scale as much)</p>
<h2 id="EFS"><a href="#EFS" class="headerlink" title="EFS"></a>EFS</h2><p>Instance Stores or EBS volumes are local disks and cannot be shared across instances. Here, we need a network file system (NFS), which is exactly what EFS is designed for.</p>
<h2 id="Redshift"><a href="#Redshift" class="headerlink" title="Redshift"></a>Redshift</h2><p>Creating a smaller cluster with the cold data would not decrease the storage cost of Redshift, which will increase as we keep on creating data. Moving the data to S3 glacier will prevent us from being able to query it. Redshift’s internal storage does not have “tiers”. Therefore, we should migrate the data to S3 IA and use Athena (serverless SQL query engine on top of S3) to analyze the cold data.</p>
<h1 id="CloundFront"><a href="#CloundFront" class="headerlink" title="CloundFront"></a>CloundFront</h1><h2 id="Origin"><a href="#Origin" class="headerlink" title="Origin"></a>Origin</h2><p>Until now, CloudFront could serve up content from Amazon S3. In content-distribution lingo, S3 was the only supported origin server. You would store your web objects (web pages, style sheets, images, JavaScript, and so forth) in S3, and then create a CloudFront distribution. Here is the basic flow:</p>
<p>Effective today we are opening up CloudFront and giving you the ability to use the origin server of your choice.</p>
<p>You can now create a CloudFront distribution using a custom origin. Each distribution will can point to an S3 or to a custom origin. This could be another storage service, or it could be something more interesting and more dynamic, such as an EC2 instance or even an Elastic Load Balancer:</p>
<h1 id="CloudFormation"><a href="#CloudFormation" class="headerlink" title="CloudFormation"></a>CloudFormation</h1><h2 id="CloudFormation-vs-Elastic-Beanstalk"><a href="#CloudFormation-vs-Elastic-Beanstalk" class="headerlink" title="CloudFormation vs Elastic Beanstalk"></a>CloudFormation vs Elastic Beanstalk</h2><p>Elastic Beanstalk provides an environment to easily deploy and run applications in the cloud.<br>CloudFormation is a convenient provisioning mechanism for a broad range of AWS resources.</p>
<h1 id="VPC"><a href="#VPC" class="headerlink" title="VPC"></a>VPC</h1><p>you can optionally connect to your own network, known as virtual private clouds (VPCs)</p>
<p>Amazon Web Services. Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Kindle Locations 153-154). Amazon Web Services. Kindle Edition. </p>
<p>Amazon VPC lets you provision a logically isolated section of the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define. You have complete control over your virtual networking environment, including selection of your own IP address ranges, creation of subnets, and configuration of route tables and network gateways. You can also create a hardware Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection between your corporate datacenter and your VPC and leverage the AWS cloud as an extension of your corporate datacenter.</p>
<h2 id="Subnet"><a href="#Subnet" class="headerlink" title="Subnet"></a>Subnet</h2><p>A subnet is a range of IP addresses in your VPC. You can launch AWS resources into a specified subnet. Use a public subnet for resources that must be connected to the internet, and a private subnet for resources that won’t be connected to the internet.<br>To protect the AWS resources in each subnet, use security groups and network access control lists (ACL).</p>
<h2 id="VPC-Endpoint"><a href="#VPC-Endpoint" class="headerlink" title="VPC Endpoint"></a>VPC Endpoint</h2><p>You must remember that the two services that use a VPC Endpoint Gateway are Amazon S3 and DynamoDB. The rest are VPC Endpoint Interface</p>
<h3 id="NACL-Network-ACL"><a href="#NACL-Network-ACL" class="headerlink" title="NACL (Network ACL)"></a>NACL (Network ACL)</h3><p>NACL is stateless.</p>
<p>• NACL are like a firewall which control traffic from and to subnet<br>• Default NACL allows everything outbound and everything inbound<br>• One NACL per Subnet, new Subnets are assigned the Default NACL<br>• Define NACL rules:<br>• Rules have a number (1-32766) and higher precedence with a lower number<br>• E.g. If you define #100 ALLOW <ip> and #200 DENY <ip> , IP will be allowed • Last rule is an asterisk (*) and denies a request in case of no rule match<br>• AWS recommends adding rules by increment of 100<br>• Newly created NACL will deny everything<br>• NACL are a great way of blocking a specific IP at the subnet level</ip></ip></p>

<ul>
<li>Your VPC automatically comes with a modifiable default network ACL. By default, it allows all inbound and outbound IPv4 traffic and, if applicable, IPv6 traffic.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="IGW-Internet-GateWay"><a href="#IGW-Internet-GateWay" class="headerlink" title="IGW (Internet GateWay)"></a>IGW (Internet GateWay)</h3><p>After creating an IGW, make sure the route tables are updated. Additionally, ensure the security group allow the ICMP protocol for ping requests</p>
<h3 id="NAT"><a href="#NAT" class="headerlink" title="NAT"></a>NAT</h3><p>NAT Instances would work but won’t scale and you would have to manage them (as they’re EC2 instances). Egress-Only Internet Gateways are for IPv6, not IPv4. Internet Gateways must be deployed in a public subnet. Therefore you must use a NAT Gateway in your public subnet in order to provide internet access to your instances in your private subnets.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-prevent-DDoS"><a href="#How-to-prevent-DDoS" class="headerlink" title="How to prevent DDoS"></a>How to prevent DDoS</h2><p>AWS provides flexible infrastructure and services that help customers implement strong DDoS mitigations and create highly available application architectures that follow AWS Best Practices for DDoS Resiliency. These include services such as Amazon Route 53, Amazon CloudFront, Elastic Load Balancing, and AWS WAF to control and absorb traffic, and deflect unwanted requests. These services integrate with AWS Shield, a managed DDoS protection service that provides always-on detection and automatic inline mitigations to safeguard web applications running on AWS.</p>
<h3 id="AWS-Shield"><a href="#AWS-Shield" class="headerlink" title="AWS Shield"></a>AWS Shield</h3><p>AWS Shield is a managed DDoS protection service that is available in two tiers: Standard and Advanced. AWS Shield Standard applies always-on detection and inline mitigation techniques, such as deterministic packet filtering and priority-based traffic shaping, to minimize application downtime and latency. </p>
<h4 id="AWS-Shield-Standard"><a href="#AWS-Shield-Standard" class="headerlink" title="AWS Shield Standard"></a>AWS Shield Standard</h4><p>It is included automatically and transparently to your Elastic Load Balancing load balancers, Amazon CloudFront distributions, and Amazon Route 53 resources at no additional cost. When you use these services that include AWS Shield Standard, you receive comprehensive availability protection against all known infrastructure layer attacks. Customers who have the technical expertise to manage their own monitoring and mitigation of application layer attacks can use AWS Shield together with AWS WAF rules to create a comprehensive DDoS attack mitigation strategy.</p>
<h4 id="AWS-Shield-Advanced"><a href="#AWS-Shield-Advanced" class="headerlink" title="AWS Shield Advanced"></a>AWS Shield Advanced</h4><p>It provides enhanced DDoS attack detection and monitoring for application-layer traffic to your Elastic Load Balancing load balancers, CloudFront distributions, Amazon Route 53 hosted zones and resources attached to an Elastic IP address, such Amazon EC2 instances. AWS Shield Advanced uses additional techniques to provide granular detection of DDoS attacks, such as resource-specific traffic monitoring to detect HTTP floods or DNS query floods. AWS Shield Advanced includes 24x7 access to the AWS DDoS Response Team (DRT), support experts who apply manual mitigations for more complex and sophisticated DDoS attacks, directly create or update AWS WAF rules, and can recommend improvements to your AWS architectures. AWS WAF is included at no additional cost for resources that you protect with AWS Shield Advanced.</p>
<p>AWS Shield Advanced includes access to near real-time metrics and reports, for extensive visibility into infrastructure layer and application layer DDoS attacks. You can combine AWS Shield Advanced metrics with additional, fine-tuned AWS WAF metrics for a more comprehensive CloudWatch monitoring and alarming strategy. Customers subscribed to AWS Shield Advanced can also apply for a credit for charges that result from scaling during a DDoS attack on protected Amazon EC2, Amazon CloudFront, Elastic Load Balancing, or Amazon Route 53 resources.

<h2 id="CIDR"><a href="#CIDR" class="headerlink" title="CIDR"></a>CIDR</h2><p>To add a CIDR block to your VPC, the following rules apply:</p>
<p>-The allowed block size is between a /28 netmask and /16 netmask.<br>-The CIDR block must not overlap with any existing CIDR block that’s associated with the VPC.<br>-You cannot increase or decrease the size of an existing CIDR block.<br>-You have a limit on the number of CIDR blocks you can associate with a VPC and the number of routes you can add to a route table. You cannot associate a CIDR block if this results in you exceeding your limits.<br>-The CIDR block must not be the same or larger than the CIDR range of a route in any of the VPC route tables. For example, if you have a route with a destination of 10.0.0.0/24 to a virtual private gateway, you cannot associate a CIDR block of the same range or larger. However, you can associate a CIDR block of 10.0.0.0/25 or smaller.<br>-The first four IP addresses and the last IP address in each subnet CIDR block are not available for you to use, and cannot be assigned to an instance.</p>
<p>IPv4 CIDR block size should be between a /16 netmask (65,536 IP addresses) and /28 netmask (16 IP addresses).<br>The first four IP addresses and the last IP address in each subnet CIDR block are NOT available for you to use, and cannot be assigned to an instance.</p>
<p>If you’re using AWS Direct Connect to connect to multiple VPCs through a direct connect gateway, the VPCs that are associated with the direct connect gateway must not have overlapping CIDR blocks.</p>
<h2 id="Subnet-Routing"><a href="#Subnet-Routing" class="headerlink" title="Subnet Routing"></a>Subnet Routing</h2><p>Each subnet must be associated with a route table, which specifies the allowed routes for outbound traffic leaving the subnet.<br>Every subnet that you create is automatically associated with the main route table for the VPC.<br>You can change the association, and you can change the contents of the main route table.<br>You can allow an instance in your VPC to initiate outbound connections to the internet over IPv4 but prevent unsolicited inbound connections from the internet using a NAT gateway or NAT instance.<br>To initiate outbound-only communication to the internet over IPv6, you can use an egress-only internet gateway</p>

If none is associated, automatically associated with the default network ACL.<br>You can associate a network ACL with multiple subnets; however, a subnet can be associated with only one network ACL at a time.<br>A network ACL contains a numbered list of rules that is evaluated in order, starting with the lowest numbered rule, to determine whether traffic is allowed in or out of any subnet associated with the network ACL.<br>The default network ACL is configured to allow all traffic to flow in and out of the subnets to which it is associated.</p>
<p>Amazon security groups and network ACLs don’t filter traffic to or from link-local addresses or AWS-reserved IPv4 addresses. Flow logs do not capture IP traffic to or from these addresses.</p>

<h2 id="VPC-NetACL"><a href="#VPC-NetACL" class="headerlink" title="VPC NetACL"></a>VPC NetACL</h2><p>A network access control list (ACL) is an optional layer of security for your VPC that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets. You might set up network ACLs with rules similar to your security groups in order to add an additional layer of security to your VPC.</p>
<p>Network ACL Rules are evaluated by rule number, <code>from lowest to highest</code>, and <code>executed immediately when a matching allow/deny rule is found</code>s.</p>
<h3 id="Internet-access"><a href="#Internet-access" class="headerlink" title="Internet access"></a>Internet access</h3><p>To enable access to or from the Internet for instances in a VPC subnet, you must do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attach an Internet Gateway to your VPC</li>
<li>Ensure that your subnet’s route table points to the Internet Gateway.</li>
<li>Ensure that instances in your subnet have a globally unique IP address (public IPv4 address, Elastic IP address, or IPv6 address).</li>
<li>Ensure that your network access control and security group rules allow the relevant traffic to flow to and from your instance</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="NAT-1"><a href="#NAT-1" class="headerlink" title="NAT"></a>NAT</h2><p>Enable instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other AWS services, but prevent the internet from initiating connections with the instances.<br>NAT Gateways<br>You must specify the public subnet in which the NAT gateway should reside.<br>You must specify an Elastic IP address to associate with the NAT gateway when you create it.</p>
<h2 id="Accessing-a-Corporate-or-Home-Network"><a href="#Accessing-a-Corporate-or-Home-Network" class="headerlink" title="Accessing a Corporate or Home Network"></a>Accessing a Corporate or Home Network</h2><p>You can optionally connect your VPC to your own corporate data center using an IPsec AWS managed VPN connection, making the AWS Cloud an extension of your data center.<br>A VPN connection consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>a virtual private gateway (which is the VPN concentrator on the Amazon side of the VPN connection) attached to your VPC.</li>
<li>a customer gateway (which is a physical device or software appliance on your side of the VPN connection) located in your data center.</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, instances that you launch into a virtual private cloud (VPC) can’t communicate with your own network. You can enable access to your network from your VPC by attaching a virtual private gateway to the VPC, creating a custom route table, updating your security group rules, and creating an AWS managed VPN connection.</p>
<p>Although the term VPN connection is a general term, in the Amazon VPC documentation, a VPN connection refers to the connection between your VPC and your own network. AWS supports Internet Protocol security (IPsec) VPN connections.</p>
<p>A customer gateway is a physical device or software application on your side of the VPN connection.</p>
<p>To create a VPN connection, you must create a customer gateway resource in AWS, which provides information to AWS about your customer gateway device. Next, you have to set up an Internet-routable IP address (static) of the customer gateway’s external interface.</p>
<p>The following diagram illustrates single VPN connections. The VPC has an attached virtual private gateway, and your remote network includes a customer gateway, which you must configure to enable the VPN connection. You set up the routing so that any traffic from the VPC bound for your network is routed to the virtual private gateway.</p>
<h2 id="AWS-PrivateLink"><a href="#AWS-PrivateLink" class="headerlink" title="AWS PrivateLink"></a>AWS PrivateLink</h2><p>It enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services, services hosted by other AWS accounts (VPC endpoint services), and supported AWS Marketplace partner services. You do not require an internet gateway, NAT device, public IP address, AWS Direct Connect connection, or VPN connection to communicate with the service. Traffic between your VPC and the service does not leave the Amazon network.</p>
<p>You can create a VPC peering connection between your VPCs, or with a VPC in another AWS account, and enable routing of traffic between the VPCs using private IP addresses. You cannot create a VPC peering connection between VPCs that have overlapping CIDR blocks.</p>
<p>Applications in an Amazon VPC can securely access AWS PrivateLink endpoints across VPC peering connections. The support of VPC peering by AWS PrivateLink makes it possible for customers to privately connect to a service even if that service’s endpoint resides in a different Amazon VPC that is connected using VPC peering.<br>AWS PrivateLink endpoints can now be accessed across both intra- and inter-region VPC peering connections.</p>
<h2 id="HA-for-VPN"><a href="#HA-for-VPN" class="headerlink" title="HA for VPN"></a>HA for VPN</h2><p> You can do the following to provide a highly available, fault-tolerant network connection:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish a hardware VPN over the Internet between the VPC and the on-premises network.</li>
<li>Establish another AWS Direct Connect connection and private virtual interface in the same AWS region. </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Q-amp-A"><a href="#Q-amp-A" class="headerlink" title="Q&amp;A"></a>Q&amp;A</h2><p>First, the Network ACL should be properly set to allow communication between the two subnets. The security group should also be properly configured so that your web server can communicate with the database server. Hence, options 1 and 4 are the correct answers:</p>
<p>Check if all security groups are set to allow the application host to communicate to the database on the right port and protocol.<br>Check the Network ACL if it allows communication between the two subnets.</p>
<p>Option 2 is incorrect because the EC2 instances do not need to be of the same class in order to communicate with each other.</p>
<p>Option 3 is incorrect because an Internet gateway is primarily used to communicate to the Internet.</p>
<p>Option 5 is incorrect because Placement Group is mainly used to provide low-latency network performance necessary for tightly-coupled node-to-node communication.</p>
<h1 id="AWS-WAF"><a href="#AWS-WAF" class="headerlink" title="AWS WAF"></a>AWS WAF</h1><p>AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect web applications from common web exploits that could affect application availability, compromise security, or consume excessive resources. You can use AWS WAF to define customizable web security rules that control which traffic accesses your web applications. If you use AWS Shield Advanced, you can use AWS WAF at no extra cost for those protected resources and can engage the DRT to create WAF rules.</p>
<p>AWS WAF rules use conditions to target specific requests and trigger an action, allowing you to identify and block common DDoS request patterns and effectively mitigate a DDoS attack. These include size constraint conditions to block a web request based on the length of its query string or request body, and geographic match conditions to implement geo restriction (also known as geoblocking) on requests that originate from specific countries. </p>

<h3 id="ALB-amp-ASG"><a href="#ALB-amp-ASG" class="headerlink" title="ALB &amp; ASG"></a>ALB &amp; ASG</h3><p>Adding the entire CIDR of the ALB would work, but wouldn’t guarantee that only the ALB can access the EC2 instances that are part of the ASG. Here, the right solution is to add a rule on the ASG security group to allow incoming traffic from the security group configured for the ALB.</p>
<h3 id="SNI"><a href="#SNI" class="headerlink" title="SNI"></a>SNI</h3><p>support for multiple TLS/SSL certificates on Application Load Balancers (ALB) using Server Name Indication (SNI). You can now host multiple TLS secured applications, each with its own TLS certificate, behind a single load balancer. In order to use SNI, all you need to do is bind multiple certificates to the same secure listener on your load balancer. ALB will automatically choose the optimal TLS certificate for each client. These new features are provided at no additional charge.</p>
<p>One of our most frequent requests on forums, reddit, and in my e-mail inbox has been to use the Server Name Indication (SNI) extension of TLS to choose a certificate for a client. Since TLS operates at the transport layer, below HTTP, it doesn’t see the hostname requested by a client. SNI works by having the client tell the server “This is the domain I expect to get a certificate for” when it first connects. The server can then choose the correct certificate to respond to the client. All modern web browsers and a large majority of other clients support SNI. In fact, today we see SNI supported by over 99.5% of clients connecting to CloudFront.</p>

When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Each AZ runs on its own physically distinct, independent infrastructure, and is engineered to be highly reliable. In case of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby (or to a read replica in the case of Amazon Aurora), so that you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete. Since the endpoint for your DB Instance remains the same after a failover, your application can resume database operation without the need for manual administrative intervention.</p>

<p>Disabling the Termination from the ASG would prevent our ASG to be Elastic and impact our costs. Making a snapshot of the EC2 instance before it gets terminated <em>could</em> work but it’s tedious, not elastic and very expensive, as all we’re interested about are log files. Using AWS Lambda would be extremely hard to use for this task. Here, the natural and by far easiest solution would be to use the CloudWatch Logs agents on the EC2 instances to automatically send log files into CloudWatch, so we can analyze them in the future easily should any problems arise.</p>
<h2 id="Auto-terminate"><a href="#Auto-terminate" class="headerlink" title="Auto terminate"></a>Auto terminate</h2><p>Using Amazon CloudWatch alarm actions, you can create alarms that automatically stop, terminate, reboot, or recover your EC2 instances. You can use the stop or terminate actions to help you save money when you no longer need an instance to be running.

<h3 id="Q-amp-A-1"><a href="#Q-amp-A-1" class="headerlink" title="Q&amp;A"></a>Q&amp;A</h3><p>you can use Amazon CloudWatch to monitor the database and then Amazon SNS to send the emails to the Operations team. Take note that you should use SNS instead of SES (Simple Email Service) when you want to monitor your EC2 instances.</p>
<p>CloudWatch collects monitoring and operational data in the form of logs, metrics, and events, providing you with a unified view of AWS resources, applications, and services that run on AWS, and on-premises servers.</p>
<p>SNS is a highly available, durable, secure, fully managed pub/sub messaging service that enables you to decouple microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.</p>
<p>Option 1 is incorrect. SES is a cloud-based email sending service designed to send notification and transactional emails.</p>
<p>Option 3 is incorrect. SQS is a fully-managed message queuing service. It does not monitor applications nor send email notifications unlike SES.</p>

<h1 id="API-Gateway"><a href="#API-Gateway" class="headerlink" title="API Gateway"></a>API Gateway</h1><p>Q: What API types are supported by Amazon API Gateway?</p>
<p>Amazon API Gateway offers two options to create RESTful APIs, HTTP APIs (Preview) and REST APIs, as well as an option to create WebSocket APIs.</p>
<p>HTTP API: HTTP APIs, currently available in Preview, are optimized for building APIs that proxy to AWS Lambda functions or HTTP backends, making them ideal for serverless workloads. They do not currently offer API management functionality.</p>
<p>REST API: REST APIs offer API proxy functionality and API management features in a single solution. REST APIs offer API management features such as usage plans, API keys, publishing, and monetizing APIs.</p>
<p>WebSocket API: WebSocket APIs maintain a persistent connection between connected clients to enable real-time message communication. With WebSocket APIs in API Gateway, you can define backend integrations with AWS Lambda functions, Amazon Kinesis, or any HTTP endpoint to be invoked when messages are received from the connected clients.</p>
<h1 id="CloudTrail"><a href="#CloudTrail" class="headerlink" title="CloudTrail"></a>CloudTrail</h1><p>To monitor the calls made to the Amazon EC2 API for your account, including calls made by the AWS Management Console, command line tools, and other services, use AWS CloudTrail.</p>
<p>In general, to analyze any API calls made within your AWS account, you should use CloudTrail</p>
<p>​
Set up a new CloudTrail trail in a new S3 bucket using the AWS CLI and also pass both the –is-multi-region-trail and –include-global-service-events parameters then encrypt log files using KMS encryption.

<h3 id="DAX"><a href="#DAX" class="headerlink" title="DAX"></a>DAX</h3><p>DAX will be transparent and won’t require an application refactoring, and will cache the “hot keys”. ElastiCache could also be a solution, but it will require a lot of refactoring work on the AWS Lambda side.</p>
<p>DynamoDB is horizontally scalable, has a DynamoDB streams capability and is multi AZ by default. On top of it, we can adjust the RCU and WCU automatically using Auto Scaling.</p>
<h2 id="DynamoDB’s-partition-key"><a href="#DynamoDB’s-partition-key" class="headerlink" title="DynamoDB’s partition key"></a>DynamoDB’s partition key</h2><p>DynamoDB supports two types of primary keys:</p>
<p>Partition key: A simple primary key, composed of one attribute known as the partition key. Attributes in DynamoDB are similar in many ways to fields or columns in other database systems.<br>Partition key and sort key: Referred to as a composite primary key, this type of key is composed of two attributes. The first attribute is the partition key, and the second attribute is the sort key. Following is an example.</p>
<h3 id="Recommendations-for-partition-keys"><a href="#Recommendations-for-partition-keys" class="headerlink" title="Recommendations for partition keys"></a>Recommendations for partition keys</h3><p>Use high-cardinality attributes. These are attributes that have distinct values for each item, like e-mailid, employee_no, customerid, sessionid, orderid, and so on.</p>
<p>Use composite attributes. Try to combine more than one attribute to form a unique key, if that meets your access pattern. For example, consider an orders table with customerid+productid+countrycode as the partition key and order_date as the sort key.</p>
<p>Cache the popular items when there is a high volume of read traffic using Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX). The cache acts as a low-pass filter, preventing reads of unusually popular items from swamping partitions. For example, consider a table that has deals information for products. Some deals are expected to be more popular than others during major sale events like Black Friday or Cyber Monday. DAX is a fully managed, in-memory cache for DynamoDB that doesn’t require developers to manage cache invalidation, data population, or cluster management. DAX also is compatible with DynamoDB API calls, so developers can incorporate it more easily into existing applications.</p>
<p>Add random numbers or digits from a predetermined range for write-heavy use cases. Suppose that you expect a large volume of writes for a partition key (for example, greater than 1000 1 K writes per second). In this case, use an additional prefix or suffix (a fixed number from predetermined range, say 1–10) and add it to the partition key.</p>
<h2 id="Aurora"><a href="#Aurora" class="headerlink" title="Aurora"></a>Aurora</h2><p>Aurora Read Replicas can be deployed globally</p>
<h3 id="Aurora-endpoints"><a href="#Aurora-endpoints" class="headerlink" title="Aurora endpoints"></a>Aurora endpoints</h3><p>Amazon Aurora typically involves a cluster of DB instances instead of a single instance. Each connection is handled by a specific DB instance. When you connect to an Aurora cluster, the host name and port that you specify point to an intermediate handler called an endpoint. Aurora uses the endpoint mechanism to abstract these connections. Thus, you don’t have to hardcode all the hostnames or write your own logic for load-balancing and rerouting connections when some DB instances aren’t available.</p>
<p>For certain Aurora tasks, different instances or groups of instances perform different roles. For example, the primary instance handles all data definition language (DDL) and data manipulation language (DML) statements. Up to 15 Aurora Replicas handle read-only query traffic.</p>
<p>Using endpoints, you can map each connection to the appropriate instance or group of instances based on your use case. For example, to perform DDL statements you can connect to whichever instance is the primary instance. To perform queries, you can connect to the reader endpoint, with Aurora automatically performing load-balancing among all the Aurora Replicas. For clusters with DB instances of different capacities or configurations, you can connect to custom endpoints associated with different subsets of DB instances. For diagnosis or tuning, you can connect to a specific instance endpoint to examine details about a specific DB instance.</p>
<h4 id="Types-of-Aurora-Endpoints"><a href="#Types-of-Aurora-Endpoints" class="headerlink" title="Types of Aurora Endpoints"></a>Types of Aurora Endpoints</h4><p>An endpoint is represented as an Aurora-specific URL that contains a host address and a port. The following types of endpoints are available from an Aurora DB cluster.</p>
<h5 id="Cluster-endpoint"><a href="#Cluster-endpoint" class="headerlink" title="Cluster endpoint"></a>Cluster endpoint</h5><p>A cluster endpoint for an Aurora DB cluster that connects to the current primary DB instance for that DB cluster. This endpoint is the only one that can perform write operations such as DDL statements. Because of this, the cluster endpoint is the one that you connect to when you first set up a cluster or when your cluster only contains a single DB instance.<br>Each Aurora DB cluster has one cluster endpoint and one primary DB instance.</p>
<p>You use the cluster endpoint for all write operations on the DB cluster, including inserts, updates, deletes, and DDL changes. You can also use the cluster endpoint for read operations, such as queries.</p>
<p>The cluster endpoint provides failover support for read/write connections to the DB cluster. If the current primary DB instance of a DB cluster fails, Aurora automatically fails over to a new primary DB instance. During a failover, the DB cluster continues to serve connection requests to the cluster endpoint from the new primary DB instance, with minimal interruption of service.</p>
<h5 id="Reader-endpoint"><a href="#Reader-endpoint" class="headerlink" title="Reader endpoint"></a>Reader endpoint</h5><p>A reader endpoint for an Aurora DB cluster connects to one of the available Aurora Replicas for that DB cluster. Each Aurora DB cluster has one reader endpoint. If there is more than one Aurora Replica, the reader endpoint directs each connection request to one of the Aurora Replicas.</p>
<p>The reader endpoint provides load-balancing support for read-only connections to the DB cluster. Use the reader endpoint for read operations, such as queries. You can’t use the reader endpoint for write operations.</p>
<h5 id="Custom-endpoint"><a href="#Custom-endpoint" class="headerlink" title="Custom endpoint"></a>Custom endpoint</h5><p>A custom endpoint for an Aurora cluster represents a set of DB instances that you choose. When you connect to the endpoint, Aurora performs load balancing and chooses one of the instances in the group to handle the connection. You define which instances this endpoint refers to, and you decide what purpose the endpoint serves.</p>
<p>An Aurora DB cluster has no custom endpoints until you create one. You can create up to five custom endpoints for each provisioned Aurora cluster. You can’t use custom endpoints for Aurora Serverless clusters.</p>
<p>The custom endpoint provides load-balanced database connections based on criteria other than the read-only or read-write capability of the DB instances. For example, you might define a custom endpoint to connect to instances that use a particular AWS instance class or a particular DB parameter group. Then you might tell particular groups of users about this custom endpoint. For example, you might direct internal users to low-capacity instances for report generation or ad hoc (one-time) querying, and direct production traffic to high-capacity instances.</p>
<p>Instead of using one DB instance for each specialized purpose and connecting to its instance endpoint, you can have multiple groups of specialized DB instances. In this case, each group has its own custom endpoint. This way, Aurora can perform load balancing among all the instances dedicated to tasks such as reporting or handling production or internal queries. The custom endpoints provide load balancing and high availability for each group of DB instances within your cluster. If one of the DB instances within a group becomes unavailable, Aurora directs subsequent custom endpoint connections to one of the other DB instances associated with the same endpoint.</p>
<h5 id="Instance-endpoint"><a href="#Instance-endpoint" class="headerlink" title="Instance endpoint"></a>Instance endpoint</h5><p>An instance endpoint connects to a specific DB instance within an Aurora cluster. Each DB instance in a DB cluster has its own unique instance endpoint. So there is one instance endpoint for the current primary DB instance of the DB cluster, and there is one instance endpoint for each of the Aurora Replicas in the DB cluster.</p>
<p>The instance endpoint provides direct control over connections to the DB cluster, for scenarios where using the cluster endpoint or reader endpoint might not be appropriate. For example, your client application might require more fine-grained load balancing based on workload type. In this case, you can configure multiple clients to connect to different Aurora Replicas in a DB cluster to distribute read workloads. </p>

Each ElastiCache for Redis node supports the Redis protocol and has its own DNS name and port. Multiple types of ElastiCache for Redis nodes are supported, each with varying amount of CPU capability, and associated memory. An ElastiCache for Redis node may take on a primary or a read replica role. A primary node can be replicated to multiple read replica nodes. An ElastiCache for Redis cluster is a collection of one or more ElastiCache for Redis nodes of the same role; the primary node will be in the primary cluster and the read replica node will be in a read replica cluster. At this time a cluster can only have one node. In the future, we will increase this limit. A cluster manages a logical key space, where each node is responsible for a part of the key space. Most of your management operations will be performed at the cluster level. An ElastiCache for Redis replication group encapsulates the primary and read replica clusters for a Redis installation. A replication group will have only one primary cluster and zero or many read replica clusters. All nodes within a replication group (and consequently cluster) will be of the same node type, and have the same parameter and security group settings.</p>
<h3 id="Does-Amazon-ElastiCache-for-Redis-support-Multi-AZ-operation"><a href="#Does-Amazon-ElastiCache-for-Redis-support-Multi-AZ-operation" class="headerlink" title="Does Amazon ElastiCache for Redis support Multi-AZ operation?"></a>Does Amazon ElastiCache for Redis support Multi-AZ operation?</h3><p>Yes, with Amazon ElastiCache for Redis you can create a read replica in another AWS Availability Zone. Upon a failure of the primary node, we will provision a new primary node. In scenarios where the primary node cannot be provisioned, you can decide which read replica to promote to be the new primary. </p>
<h3 id="What-is-Multi-AZ-for-an-ElastiCache-for-Redis-replication-group"><a href="#What-is-Multi-AZ-for-an-ElastiCache-for-Redis-replication-group" class="headerlink" title="What is Multi-AZ for an ElastiCache for Redis replication group?"></a>What is Multi-AZ for an ElastiCache for Redis replication group?</h3><p>An ElastiCache for Redis replication group consists of a primary and up to five read replicas. Redis asynchronously replicates the data from the primary to the read replicas. During certain types of planned maintenance, or in the unlikely event of ElastiCache node failure or Availability Zone failure, Amazon ElastiCache will automatically detect the failure of a primary, select a read replica, and promote it to become the new primary. ElastiCache also propagates the DNS changes of the promoted read replica, so if your application is writing to the primary node endpoint, no endpoint change will be needed.</p>

At the time of Redis cluster creation via the console or command line interface, you can specify if you want to enable encryption and Redis AUTH and can proceed to provide an authentication token for communication with the Redis cluster. Once the cluster is setup with encryption enabled, ElastiCache seamlessly manages certificate expiration and renewal without requiring any additional action from the application. Additionally, the Redis clients need to support TLS to avail of the encrypted in-transit traffic.</p>
<h3 id="Is-Redis-password-functionality-supported-in-Amazon-ElastiCache-for-Redis"><a href="#Is-Redis-password-functionality-supported-in-Amazon-ElastiCache-for-Redis" class="headerlink" title="Is Redis password functionality supported in Amazon ElastiCache for Redis?"></a>Is Redis password functionality supported in Amazon ElastiCache for Redis?</h3><p>Yes, Amazon ElastiCache for Redis supports Redis passwords via Redis AUTH feature. It is an opt-in feature available in ElastiCache for Redis version 3.2.6 onwards. You must enable encryption in-transit to use Redis AUTH on your ElastiCache for Redis cluster.</p>
<h3 id="encryption"><a href="#encryption" class="headerlink" title="encryption"></a>encryption</h3><p>ElastiCache for Redis at-rest encryption is an optional feature to increase data security by encrypting on-disk data. When enabled on a replication group, it encrypts the following aspects:</p>
<p>Disk during sync, backup and swap operations</p>
<p>Backups stored in Amazon S3</p>
<p>ElastiCache for Redis offers default (service managed) encryption at rest, as well as ability to use your own symetric customer managed customer master keys in AWS Key Management Service (KMS).</p>
<h4 id="KMS"><a href="#KMS" class="headerlink" title="KMS"></a>KMS</h4><p>Manage keys used for encrypted DB instances using the AWS KMS. KMS encryption keys are specific to the region that they are created in.</p>
<h1 id="BYOIP"><a href="#BYOIP" class="headerlink" title="BYOIP"></a>BYOIP</h1><p>You can bring part or all of your public IPv4 address range from your on-premises network to your AWS account. You continue to own the address range, but AWS advertises it on the Internet. After you bring the address range to AWS, it appears in your account as an address pool. You can create an Elastic IP address from your address pool and use it with your AWS resources, such as EC2 instances, NAT gateways, and Network Load Balancers. This is also called “Bring Your Own IP Addresses (BYOIP)”.</p>
<p>To ensure that only you can bring your address range to your AWS account, you must authorize Amazon to advertise the address range and provide proof that you own the address range.</p>
<p>A Route Origin Authorization (ROA) is a document that you can create through your Regional internet registry (RIR), such as the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) or Réseaux IP Européens Network Coordination Centre (RIPE). It contains the address range, the ASNs that are allowed to advertise the address range, and an expiration date. Hence, Option 3 is the correct answer.</p>
<p>The ROA authorizes Amazon to advertise an address range under a specific AS number. However, it does not authorize your AWS account to bring the address range to AWS. To authorize your AWS account to bring an address range to AWS, you must publish a self-signed X509 certificate in the RDAP remarks for the address range. The certificate contains a public key, which AWS uses to verify the authorization-context signature that you provide. You should keep your private key secure and use it to sign the authorization-context message.</p>
<p>Option 1 is incorrect because you cannot map the IP address of your on-premises network, which you are migrating to AWS, to an EIP address of your VPC. To satisfy the requirement, you must authorize Amazon to advertise the address range that you own.</p>
<p>Option 2 is incorrect because the IP match condition in CloudFront is primarily used in allowing or blocking the incoming web requests based on the IP addresses that the requests originate from. This is the opposite of what is being asked in the scenario, where you have to migrate your suite of applications from your on-premises network and advertise the address range that you own in your VPC.</p>
<p>Option 4 is incorrect because you don’t need to submit an AWS request in order to do this. You can simply create a Route Origin Authorization (ROA) then once done, provision and advertise your whitelisted IP address range to your AWS account.</p>

<p>In Amazon SQS, you can configure the message retention period to a value from 1 minute to 14 days. The default is 4 days. Once the message retention limit is reached, your messages are automatically deleted.</p>
<p>A single Amazon SQS message queue can contain an unlimited number of messages. However, there is a 120,000 limit for the number of inflight messages for a standard queue and 20,000 for a FIFO queue. Messages are inflight after they have been received from the queue by a consuming component, but have not yet been deleted from the queue.</p>

<h1 id="Q-amp-A-2"><a href="#Q-amp-A-2" class="headerlink" title="Q&amp;A"></a>Q&amp;A</h1><ul>
<li><p>Lambda would time out after 15 minutes (2000*3=6000 seconds = 100 minutes). Glue is for performing ETL, but cannot run custom Python scripts. Kinesis Streams is for real time data (here we are in a batch setup), RDS could be used to run SQL queries on the data, but no Python script. The correct answer is EC2</p>
</li>
<li><p>Elastic Beanstalk cannot manage AWS Lambda functions, OpsWorks is for Chef / Puppet, and Trusted Advisor is to get recommendations regarding the 5 pillars of the well architected framework.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Kinesis cannot scale infinitely and we may have the same throughput issues. SNS won’t keep our data if it cannot be delivered, and DAX is used for caching reads, not to help with writes. Here, using SQS as a middleware will help us sustain the write throughput during write peaks</p>
</li>
<li><p>CloudFront is not a good solution here as the content is highly dynamic, and CloudFront will cache things. Dynamic applications cannot be deployed to S3, and Route53 does not help in scaling your application. ASG is the correct answer here</p>
</li>
<li><p>Network Load Balancers expose a fixed IP to the public web, therefore allowing your application to be predictably reached using these IPs, while allowing you to scale your application behind the Network Load Balancer using an ASG. Application and Classic Load Balancers expose a fixed DNS (=URL). Finally, the ASG does not have a dynamic Elastic IPs attachment feature</p>
</li>
<li><p>Hosting the master pack into S3 will require an application code refactor. Upgrading the EC2 instances won’t help save network cost and ELB does not have any caching capability. Here you need to create a CloudFront distribution to add a caching layer in front of your ELB. That caching layer will be very effective as the image pack is a static file, and tremendously save in network cost.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Adding Aurora Read Replicas would greatly increase the cost, switching to a Load Balancer would not improve the problems, and AWS Lambda has no native in memory caching capability. Here, using API Gateway Caching feature is the answer, as we can accept to serve stale data to our users</p>
</li>
<li><p>SQS will allow you to buffer the image compression requests and process them asynchronously. It also has a direct built-in mechanism for retries and scales seamlessly. To process these jobs, due to the unpredictable nature of their volume, and the desire to save on costs, Spot Instances are recommended.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Distributing the static content through S3 allows to offload most of the network usage to S3 and free up our applications running on ECS. EFS will not change anything as static content on EFS would still have to be distributed by our ECS instances</p>
</li>
<li><p>S3 does not work as overwrites are eventually consistent so the latest data will not always be read. Neptune is a graph database so it’s not a good fit, ElastiCache could work but it’s a better fit as a caching technology to enhance reads. Here, the best fit is RDS.</p>
</li>
<li><p>RDS Multi AZ helps with disaster recovery in case of an AZ failure. ElastiCache would definitely help with the read load, but would require a refactor of the application’s core logic. DynamoDB with DAX would also probably help with the read load, but once again it would require a refactor of the application’s core logic. Here, our only option to scale reads is to use RDS Read Replicas</p>
</li>
<li><p>Which of the following AWS services encrypts data at rest by default? (Choose 2)<br>All data transferred between any type of gateway appliance and AWS storage is encrypted using SSL. By default, all data stored by AWS Storage Gateway in S3 is encrypted server-side with Amazon S3-Managed Encryption Keys (SSE-S3). Also, when using the file gateway, you can optionally configure each file share to have your objects encrypted with AWS KMS-Managed Keys using SSE-KMS. This is the reason why Option 1 is correct.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Data stored in Amazon Glacier is protected by default; only vault owners have access to the Amazon Glacier resources they create. Amazon Glacier encrypts your data at rest by default and supports secure data transit with SSL. This is the reason why Option 4 is correct.</p>
<p>Although Amazon RDS, ECS and Lambda all support encryption, you still have to enable and configure them first with tools like AWS KMS to encrypt the data at rest.</p>

            <h1 id="Kafka"><a href="#Kafka" class="headerlink" title="Kafka"></a>Kafka</h1><p>Kafka is fast. A single node can handle hundreds of read/writes from thousands of clients in real time. Kafka is also distributed and scalable. It creates and takes down nodes in an elastic manner, without incurring any downtime. Data streams are split into partitions and spread over different brokers for capability and redundancy.</p>
<h1 id="History-of-Kafka"><a href="#History-of-Kafka" class="headerlink" title="History of Kafka"></a>History of Kafka</h1><p>The result was a publish/subscribe messaging system that had an interface typical of messaging systems but a storage layer more like a log-aggregation system. Combined with the adoption of Apache Avro for message serialization, Kafka was effective for handling both metrics and user-activity tracking at a scale of billions of messages per day.</p>
<h2 id="Kafka-features"><a href="#Kafka-features" class="headerlink" title="Kafka features"></a>Kafka features</h2><ul>
<li><p>Language Agnostic<br>Producers and consumers use binary protocol to talk to a Kafka cluster.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Durability<br>Kafka does not track which messages were read by each consumer. Kafka keeps all messages for a finite amount of time, and it is consumers’ responsibility to track their location per topic, i.e. offsets.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Terminology"><a href="#Terminology" class="headerlink" title="Terminology:"></a>Terminology:</h2><p>Topic: a feed of messages or packages<br>Partition: group of topics split for scalability and redundancy<br>Producer: process that introduces messages into the queue<br>Consumer: process that subscribes to various topics and processes from a feed of published messages<br>Broker: a node that is part of the Kafka cluster</p>
<h2 id="Topics-and-Partitions"><a href="#Topics-and-Partitions" class="headerlink" title="Topics and Partitions"></a>Topics and Partitions</h2><p>Messages in Kafka are categorized into topics. The closest analogies for a topic are a database table or a folder in a filesystem. Topics are additionally broken down into a number of partitions. Going back to the “commit log” description, a partition is a sin‐ gle log. Messages are written to it in an append-only fashion, and are read in order from beginning to end. Note that as a topic typically has multiple partitions, there is no guarantee of message time-ordering across the entire topic, just within a single partition. </p>
<p>Partitions are also the way that Kafka provides redundancy and scalability. Each partition can be hosted on a different server, which means that a single topic can be scaled horizontally across multiple servers to provide performance far beyond the ability of a single server.</p>
<h1 id="Producers-and-consumers"><a href="#Producers-and-consumers" class="headerlink" title="Producers and consumers"></a>Producers and consumers</h1><p>Kafka clients are users of the system, and there are two basic types: producers and consumers. There are also advanced client APIs—Kafka Connect API for data inte‐ gration and Kafka Streams for stream processing. The advanced clients use producers and consumers as building blocks and provide higher-level functionality on top.</p>
<h2 id="producers"><a href="#producers" class="headerlink" title="producers"></a>producers</h2><p>Producers create new messages. In other publish/subscribe systems, these may be called publishers or writers. In general, a message will be produced to a specific topic. By default, the producer does not care what partition a specific message is written to and will balance messages over all partitions of a topic evenly. In some cases, the pro‐ ducer will direct messages to specific partitions. This is typically done using the mes‐ sage key and a partitioner that will generate a hash of the key and map it to a specific partition. This assures that all messages produced with a given key will get written to the same partition. The producer could also use a custom partitioner that follows other business rules for mapping messages to partitions.</p>
<h2 id="Consumers"><a href="#Consumers" class="headerlink" title="Consumers"></a>Consumers</h2><p>Consumers read messages. In other publish/subscribe systems, these clients may be called subscribers or readers. The consumer subscribes to one or more topics and reads the messages in the order in which they were produced. The consumer keeps track of which messages it has already consumed by keeping track of the offset of messages. The offset is another bit of metadata—an integer value that continually increases—that Kafka adds to each message as it is produced. Each message in a given partition has a unique offset. By storing the offset of the last consumed message for each partition, either in Zookeeper or in Kafka itself, a consumer can stop and restart without losing its place.</p>
<p>Consumers work as part of a consumer group, which is one or more consumers that work together to consume a topic. The group assures that each partition is only con‐ sumed by one member. there are three consumers in a single group consuming a topic. Two of the consumers are working from one partition each, while the third consumer is working from two partitions. The mapping of a consumer to a partition is often called ownership of the partition by the consumer.</p>
<h3 id="Consumer-group"><a href="#Consumer-group" class="headerlink" title="Consumer group"></a>Consumer group</h3><p>Consumers may be grouped in a consumer group with multiple consumers. Each consumer in a consumer group will read messages from a unique subset of partitions in each topic they subscribe to. Each message is delivered to one consumer in the group, and all messages with the same key arrive at the same consumer.</p>
<h2 id="Brokers-and-Clusters"><a href="#Brokers-and-Clusters" class="headerlink" title="Brokers and Clusters"></a>Brokers and Clusters</h2><p>A single Kafka server is called a broker. The broker receives messages from producers, assigns offsets to them, and commits the messages to storage on disk. It also services consumers, responding to fetch requests for partitions and responding with the mes‐ sages that have been committed to disk. Depending on the specific hardware and its performance characteristics, a single broker can easily handle thousands of partitions and millions of messages per second.<br>Kafka brokers are designed to operate as part of a cluster. Within a cluster of brokers, one broker will also function as the cluster controller (elected automatically from the live members of the cluster). The controller is responsible for administrative operations, including assigning partitions to brokers and monitoring for broker failures. A partition is owned by a single broker in the cluster, and that broker is called the leader of the partition. A partition may be assigned to multiple brokers, which will result in the partition being replicated This provides redundancy of messages in the partition, such that another broker can take over leadership if there is a broker failure. However, all consumers and producers operating on that partition must connect to the leader. </p>
<h2 id="retentions"><a href="#retentions" class="headerlink" title="retentions"></a>retentions</h2><p>A key feature of Apache Kafka is that of retention, which is the durable storage of messages for some period of time. Kafka brokers are configured with a default reten‐ tion setting for topics, either retaining messages for some period of time (e.g., 7 days) or until the topic reaches a certain size in bytes (e.g., 1 GB). Once these limits are reached, messages are expired and deleted so that the retention configuration is a minimum amount of data available at any time. Individual topics can also be config‐ ured with their own retention settings so that messages are stored for only as long as they are useful. For example, a tracking topic might be retained for several days, whereas application metrics might be retained for only a few hours. Topics can also be configured as log compacted, which means that Kafka will retain only the last mes‐ sage produced with a specific key. This can be useful for changelog-type data, where only the last update is interesting.</p>
<h2 id="mirror-maker"><a href="#mirror-maker" class="headerlink" title="mirror maker"></a>mirror maker</h2><p>The Kafka project includes a tool called MirrorMaker, used for this purpose. At its core, MirrorMaker is simply a Kafka consumer and producer, linked together with a queue. Messages are consumed from one Kafka cluster and produced for another.</p>
<h1 id="Why-Kafka"><a href="#Why-Kafka" class="headerlink" title="Why Kafka?"></a>Why Kafka?</h1><h2 id="Multiple-Producers"><a href="#Multiple-Producers" class="headerlink" title="Multiple Producers"></a>Multiple Producers</h2><p>Kafka is able to seamlessly handle multiple producers, whether those clients are using many topics or the same topic. </p>
<h2 id="Multiple-Consumers"><a href="#Multiple-Consumers" class="headerlink" title="Multiple Consumers"></a>Multiple Consumers</h2><p>In addition to multiple producers, Kafka is designed for multiple consumers to read any single stream of messages without interfering with each other. This is in contrast to many queuing systems where once a message is consumed by one client, it is not available to any other. Multiple Kafka consumers can choose to operate as part of a group and share a stream, assuring that the entire group processes a given message only once.</p>
<p>##Disk-Based Retention<br>Not only can Kafka handle multiple consumers, but durable message retention means that consumers do not always need to work in real time. Messages are committed to disk, and will be stored with configurable retention rules. </p>
<h2 id="Scalable"><a href="#Scalable" class="headerlink" title="Scalable"></a>Scalable</h2><p>Kafka’s flexible scalability makes it easy to handle any amount of data. Users can start with a single broker as a proof of concept, expand to a small development cluster of three brokers, and move into production with a larger cluster of tens or even hun‐ dreds of brokers that grows over time as the data scales up.</p>
<h2 id="High-Performance"><a href="#High-Performance" class="headerlink" title="High Performance"></a>High Performance</h2><p>All of these features come together to make Apache Kafka a publish/subscribe mes‐ saging system with excellent performance under high load. Producers, consumers, and brokers can all be scaled out to handle very large message streams with ease. This can be done while still providing subsecond message latency from producing a mes‐ sage to availability to consumers.</p>
<h1 id="Process-of-producing-message"><a href="#Process-of-producing-message" class="headerlink" title="Process of producing message"></a>Process of producing message</h1><p>We start producing messages to Kafka by creating a ProducerRecord, which must include the topic we want to send the record to and a value. Optionally, we can also specify a key and/or a partition. Once we send the ProducerRecord, the first thing the producer will do is serialize the key and value objects to ByteArrays so they can be sent over the network.<br>Next, the data is sent to a partitioner. If we specified a partition in the ProducerRecord, the partitioner doesn’t do anything and simply returns the partition we specified. If we didn’t, the partitioner will choose a partition for us, usually based on the ProducerRecord key. Once a partition is selected, the producer knows which topic and partition the record will go to. It then adds the record to a batch of records that will also be sent to the same topic and partition. A separate thread is responsible for sending those batches of records to the appropriate Kafka brokers.<br>When the broker receives the messages, it sends back a response. If the messages were successfully written to Kafka, it will return a RecordMetadata object with the topic, partition, and the offset of the record within the partition. If the broker failed to write the messages, it will return an error. When the producer receives an error, it may retry sending the message a few more times before giving up and returning an error.</p>
<h1 id="Constructing-a-Kafka-Producer"><a href="#Constructing-a-Kafka-Producer" class="headerlink" title="Constructing a Kafka Producer"></a>Constructing a Kafka Producer</h1><p>The first step in writing messages to Kafka is to create a producer object with the properties you want to pass to the producer. A Kafka producer has three mandatory properties:</p>
<h2 id="bootstrap-servers"><a href="#bootstrap-servers" class="headerlink" title="bootstrap.servers"></a>bootstrap.servers</h2><p>List of host:port pairs of brokers that the producer will use to establish initial connection to the Kafka cluster. This list doesn’t need to include all brokers, since the producer will get more information after the initial connection. But it is rec‐ ommended to include at least two, so in case one broker goes down, the producer will still be able to connect to the cluster.</p>
<h2 id="key-serializer"><a href="#key-serializer" class="headerlink" title="key.serializer"></a>key.serializer</h2><p>Name of a class that will be used to serialize the keys of the records we will pro‐ duce to Kafka. Kafka brokers expect byte arrays as keys and values of messages. However, the producer interface allows, using parameterized types, any Java object to be sent as a key and value. This makes for very readable code, but it also means that the producer has to know how to convert these objects to byte arrays. key.serializer should be set to a name of a class that implements the org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.Serializer interface. The producer will use this class to serialize the key object to a byte array. The Kafka client pack‐ age includes ByteArraySerializer (which doesn’t do much), StringSerializer, and IntegerSerializer, so if you use common types, there is no need to implement your own serializers. Setting key.serializer is required even if you intend to send only values.</p>
<h2 id="value-serializer"><a href="#value-serializer" class="headerlink" title="value.serializer"></a>value.serializer</h2><p>Name of a class that will be used to serialize the values of the records we will pro‐ duce to Kafka. The same way you set key.serializer to a name of a class that will serialize the message key object to a byte array, you set value.serializer to a class that will serialize the message value object.</p>
<h2 id="Sample-code-to-generate-producer-record"><a href="#Sample-code-to-generate-producer-record" class="headerlink" title="Sample code to generate producer record"></a>Sample code to generate producer record</h2><figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br><span class="line">2</span><br><span class="line">3</span><br><span class="line">4</span><br><span class="line">5</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="keyword">private</span> Properties kafkaProps = <span class="keyword">new</span> Properties();</span><br><span class="line">    kafkaProps.put(<span class="string">"bootstrap.servers"</span>, <span class="string">"broker1:9092,broker2:9092"</span>);</span><br><span class="line">    kafkaProps.put(<span class="string">"key.serializer"</span>,       <span class="string">"org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer"</span>);</span><br><span class="line">    kafkaProps.put(<span class="string">"value.serializer"</span>, <span class="string">"org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringSerializer"</span>);</span><br><span class="line">    producer = <span class="keyword">new</span> KafkaProducer&lt;String, String&gt;(kafkaProps);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<h2 id="Deliver-message"><a href="#Deliver-message" class="headerlink" title="Deliver message"></a>Deliver message</h2><p>Once we instantiate a producer, it is time to start sending messages. There are three primary methods of sending messages:</p>
<h3 id="Fire-and-forget"><a href="#Fire-and-forget" class="headerlink" title="Fire-and-forget"></a>Fire-and-forget</h3><p>We send a message to the server and don’t really care if it arrives succesfully or not. Most of the time, it will arrive successfully, since Kafka is highly available and the producer will retry sending messages automatically. However, some mes‐ sages will get lost using this method.</p>
<h3 id="Synchronous-send"><a href="#Synchronous-send" class="headerlink" title="Synchronous send"></a>Synchronous send</h3><p>We send a message, the send() method returns a Future object, and we use get() to wait on the future and see if the send() was successful or not.</p>

As we’ve seen in the producer architecture diagram in Figure 3-1, the message will be placed in a buffer and will be sent to the broker in a separate thread.

<h2 id="Rebalancing"><a href="#Rebalancing" class="headerlink" title="Rebalancing"></a>Rebalancing</h2><p>Moving partition ownership from one consumer to another is called a rebalance. Rebalances are important because they provide the consumer group with high availa‐ bility and scalability (allowing us to easily and safely add and remove consumers), but in the normal course of events they are fairly undesirable. During a rebalance, con‐ sumers can’t consume messages, so a rebalance is basically a short window of unavail‐ ability of the entire consumer group. In addition, when partitions are moved from one consumer to another, the consumer loses its current state; if it was caching any data, it will need to refresh its caches—slowing down the application until the con‐ sumer sets up its state again. Throughout this chapter we will discuss how to safely handle rebalances and how to avoid unnecessary ones.</p>

The subcribe() method takes a list of topics as a parameter, so it’s pretty simple to use:</p>
<figure class="highlight java"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">consumer.subscribe(Collections.singletonList(<span class="string">"customerCountries"</span>));</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

<h3 id="Sample-consumer-code"><a href="#Sample-consumer-code" class="headerlink" title="Sample consumer code"></a>Sample consumer code</h3><p>The Poll Loop<br>At the heart of the consumer API is a simple loop for polling the server for more data. Once the consumer subscribes to topics, the poll loop handles all details of coordina‐ tion, partition rebalances, heartbeats, and data fetching, leaving the developer with a clean API that simply returns available data from the assigned partitions. The main body of a consumer will look as follows:</p>

<h3 id="Thread-safety"><a href="#Thread-safety" class="headerlink" title="Thread safety"></a>Thread safety</h3><p>Thread Safety<br>You can’t have multiple consumers that belong to the same group in one thread and you can’t have multiple threads safely use the same consumer. One consumer per thread is the rule. To run mul‐ tiple consumers in the same group in one application, you will need to run each in its own thread. It is useful to wrap the con‐ sumer logic in its own object and then use Java’s ExecutorService to start multiple threads each with its own consumer. </p>
<h2 id="Commit"><a href="#Commit" class="headerlink" title="Commit"></a>Commit</h2><p>As discussed before, one of Kafka’s unique characteristics is that it does not track acknowledgments from consumers the way many JMS queues do. Instead, it allows consumers to use Kafka to track their posi‐ tion (offset) in each partition.<br>We call the action of updating the current position in the partition a commit.</p>
<p>How does a consumer commit an offset? It produces a message to Kafka, to a special <code>__consumer_offsets</code> topic, with the committed offset for each partition. As long as all your consumers are up, running, and churning away, this will have no impact. However, if a consumer crashes or a new consumer joins the consumer group, this will trigger a rebalance. After a rebalance, each consumer may be assigned a new set of partitions than the one it processed before. In order to know where to pick up the work, the consumer will read the latest committed offset of each partition and con‐ tinue from there.</p>
<h3 id="Automatic-Commit"><a href="#Automatic-Commit" class="headerlink" title="Automatic Commit"></a>Automatic Commit</h3><p>With autocommit enabled, a call to poll will always commit the last offset returned by the previous poll. It doesn’t know which events were actually processed, so it is critical to always process all the events returned by poll() before calling poll() again. (Just like poll(), close() also commits offsets automatically.) This is usually not an issue, but pay attention when you handle exceptions or exit the poll loop prematurely.</p>
<h3 id="Manual-commit"><a href="#Manual-commit" class="headerlink" title="Manual commit"></a>Manual commit</h3><p>It is important to remember that commitSync() will commit the latest offset returned by poll(), so make sure you call commitSync() after you are done processing all the records in the collection, or you risk missing messages as described previously. When rebalance is triggered, all the messages from the beginning of the most recent batch until the time of the rebalance will be processed twice.<br>Here is how we would use commitSync to commit offsets after we finished processing the latest batch of messages:</p>

<h2 id="Combining-Synchronous-and-Asynchronous-Commits"><a href="#Combining-Synchronous-and-Asynchronous-Commits" class="headerlink" title="Combining Synchronous and Asynchronous Commits"></a>Combining Synchronous and Asynchronous Commits</h2><p>Normally, occasional failures to commit without retrying are not a huge problem because if the problem is temporary, the following commit will be successful. But if we know that this is the last commit before we close the consumer, or before a reba‐ lance, we want to make extra sure that the commit succeeds.<br>Therefore, a common pattern is to combine commitAsync() with commitSync() just before shutdown. Here is how it works (we will discuss how to commit just before rebalance when we get to the section about rebalance listeners):</p>

<h2 id="Exit"><a href="#Exit" class="headerlink" title="Exit"></a>Exit</h2><p>When you decide to exit the poll loop, you will need another thread to call con sumer.wakeup(). If you are running the consumer loop in the main thread, this can be done from ShutdownHook. <code>Note that consumer.wakeup() is the only consumer method that is safe to call from a different thread.</code> Calling wakeup will cause poll() to exit with WakeupException, or if consumer.wakeup() was called while the thread was not waiting on poll, the exception will be thrown on the next iteration when poll() is called. </p>
<h1 id="The-Controller"><a href="#The-Controller" class="headerlink" title="The Controller"></a>The Controller</h1><p>The controller is one of the Kafka brokers that, in addition to the usual broker func‐ tionality, is responsible for electing partition leaders (we’ll discuss partition leaders and what they do in the next section). The first broker that starts in the cluster becomes the controller by creating an ephemeral node in ZooKeeper called /control ler. When other brokers start, they also try to create this node, but receive a “node already exists” exception, which causes them to “realize” that the controller node already exists and that the cluster already has a controller. </p>
<h1 id="Replication"><a href="#Replication" class="headerlink" title="Replication"></a>Replication</h1><p>Replication is at the heart of Kafka’s architecture. The very first sentence in Kafka’s documentation describes it as “a distributed, partitioned, replicated commit log ser‐ vice.” Replication is critical because it is the way Kafka guarantees availability and durability when individual nodes inevitably fail.</p>
<h2 id="Memeroy"><a href="#Memeroy" class="headerlink" title="Memeroy"></a>Memeroy</h2><p>Kafka should run entirely on RAM. JVM heap size shouldn’t be bigger than your available RAM. That is to avoid swapping.</p>
<h3 id="Swap-usage"><a href="#Swap-usage" class="headerlink" title="Swap usage"></a>Swap usage</h3><p>Watch for swap usage, as it will degrade performance on Kafka and lead to operations timing out (set vm.swappiness = 0).    When used swap is &gt; 128MB.</p>
<h1 id="Kafka-Monitoring-Tools"><a href="#Kafka-Monitoring-Tools" class="headerlink" title="Kafka Monitoring Tools"></a>Kafka Monitoring Tools</h1><p>Any monitoring tools with JMX support should be able to monitor a Kafka cluster. Here are 3 monitoring tools we liked:</p>
<p>First one is check_kafka.pl from Hari Sekhon. It performs a complete end to end test, i.e. it inserts a message in Kafka as a producer and then extracts it as a consumer. This makes our life easier when measuring service times.</p>
<p>Another useful tool is KafkaOffsetMonitor for monitoring Kafka consumers and their position (offset) in the queue. It aids our understanding of how our queue grows and which consumers groups are lagging behind.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the LinkedIn folks have developed what we think is the smartest tool out there: Burrow. It analyzes consumer offsets and lags over a window of time and determines the consumer status. You can retrieve this status over an HTTP endpoint and then plug it into your favourite monitoring tool (Server Density for example).</p>
<p>Oh, and we would be amiss if we didn’t mention Yahoo’s Kafka-Manager. While it does include some basic monitoring, it is more of a management tool. If you are just looking for a Kafka management tool, check out AirBnb’s kafkat.</p>

<h1 id="Security"><a href="#Security" class="headerlink" title="Security"></a>Security</h1><p>The keystore stores each machine’s own identity. The truststore stores all the certificates that the machine should trust. Importing a certificate into one’s truststore also means trusting all certificates that are signed by that certificate. As the analogy above, trusting the government (CA) also means trusting all passports (certificates) that it has issued. This attribute is called the chain of trust, and it is particularly useful when deploying SSL on a large Kafka cluster. You can sign all certificates in the cluster with a single CA, and have all machines share the same truststore that trusts the CA. That way all machines can authenticate all other machines.</p>
<p>To deploy SSL, the general steps are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate the keys and certificates</li>
<li>Create your own Certificate Authority (CA)</li>
<li>Sign the certificate</li>
</ul>
<p>Generate the key and the certificate for each Kafka broker in the cluster. Generate the key into a keystore called kafka.server.keystore so that you can export and sign it later with CA. The keystore file contains the private key of the certificate; therefore, it needs to be kept safely.</p>

It decouples authentication mechanisms from application protocols, in theory allowing any authentication mechanism supported by SASL to be used in any application protocol that uses SASL. Authentication mechanisms can also support proxy authorization, a facility allowing one user to assume the identity of another. They can also provide a data security layer offering data integrity and data confidentiality services. DIGEST-MD5 provides an example of mechanisms which can provide a data-security layer. Application protocols that support SASL typically also support Transport Layer Security (TLS) to complement the services offered by SASL.</p>

            <p>Enable Kafka listener annotated endpoints that are created under the covers by a AbstractListenerContainerFactory. To be used on Configuration classes as follows:<br>   @Configuration<br>   @EnableKafka<br>   public class AppConfig {<br>       @Bean<br>       public ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory myKafkaListenerContainerFactory() {<br>           ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory factory = new ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory();<br>           factory.setConsumerFactory(consumerFactory());<br>           factory.setConcurrency(4);<br>           return factory;<br>       }<br>       // other @Bean definitions<br>   }</p>
<p>The KafkaListenerContainerFactory is responsible to create the listener container for a particular endpoint. Typical implementations, as the ConcurrentKafkaListenerContainerFactory used in the sample above, provides the necessary configuration options that are supported by the underlying MessageListenerContainer.<br>@EnableKafka enables detection of KafkaListener annotations on any Spring-managed bean in the container. For example, given a class MyService:<br>   package com.acme.foo;</p>
<p>   public class MyService {<br>       @KafkaListener(containerFactory = “myKafkaListenerContainerFactory”, topics = “myTopic”)<br>       public void process(String msg) {<br>           // process incoming message<br>       }<br>   }</p>
<p>The container factory to use is identified by the containerFactory attribute defining the name of the KafkaListenerContainerFactory bean to use. When none is set a KafkaListenerContainerFactory bean with name kafkaListenerContainerFactory is assumed to be present.<br>the following configuration would ensure that every time a message is received from topic “myQueue”, MyService.process() is called with the content of the message:<br>   @Configuration<br>   @EnableKafka<br>   public class AppConfig {<br>       @Bean<br>       public MyService myService() {<br>           return new MyService();<br>       }</p>
<pre><code>// Kafka infrastructure setup</code></pre><p>   }</p>
<p>Alternatively, if MyService were annotated with @Component, the following configuration would ensure that its @KafkaListener annotated method is invoked with a matching incoming message:<br>   @Configuration<br>   @EnableKafka<br>   @ComponentScan(basePackages = “com.acme.foo”)<br>   public class AppConfig {<br>   }</p>
<p>Note that the created containers are not registered with the application context but can be easily located for management purposes using the KafkaListenerEndpointRegistry.<br>Annotated methods can use a flexible signature; in particular, it is possible to use the Message abstraction and related annotations, see KafkaListener Javadoc for more details. For instance, the following would inject the content of the message and the kafka partition header:<br>   @KafkaListener(containerFactory = “myKafkaListenerContainerFactory”, topics = “myTopic”)<br>   public void process(String msg, @Header(“kafka_partition”) int partition) {<br>       // process incoming message<br>   }</p>
<p>These features are abstracted by the MessageHandlerMethodFactory that is responsible to build the necessary invoker to process the annotated method. By default, DefaultMessageHandlerMethodFactory is used.<br>When more control is desired, a @Configuration class may implement KafkaListenerConfigurer. This allows access to the underlying KafkaListenerEndpointRegistrar instance. The following example demonstrates how to specify an explicit default KafkaListenerContainerFactory<br>   {<br>       @code<br>       @Configuration<br>       @EnableKafka<br>       public class AppConfig implements KafkaListenerConfigurer {<br>           @Override<br>           public void configureKafkaListeners(KafkaListenerEndpointRegistrar registrar) {<br>               registrar.setContainerFactory(myKafkaListenerContainerFactory());<br>           }</p>
<pre><code>    @Bean
    public KafkaListenerContainerFactory&lt;?, ?&gt; myKafkaListenerContainerFactory() {
        // factory settings
    }

    @Bean
    public MyService myService() {
        return new MyService();
    }
}</code></pre><p>   }</p>
<p>It is also possible to specify a custom KafkaListenerEndpointRegistry in case you need more control on the way the containers are created and managed. The example below also demonstrates how to customize the org.springframework.messaging.handler.annotation.support.DefaultMessageHandlerMethodFactory as well as how to supply a custom Validator so that payloads annotated with Validated are first validated against a custom Validator.<br>   {<br>       @code<br>       @Configuration<br>       @EnableKafka<br>       public class AppConfig implements KafkaListenerConfigurer {<br>           @Override<br>           public void configureKafkaListeners(KafkaListenerEndpointRegistrar registrar) {<br>               registrar.setEndpointRegistry(myKafkaListenerEndpointRegistry());<br>               registrar.setMessageHandlerMethodFactory(myMessageHandlerMethodFactory);<br>               registrar.setValidator(new MyValidator());<br>           }</p>
<pre><code>    @Bean
    public KafkaListenerEndpointRegistry myKafkaListenerEndpointRegistry() {
        // registry configuration
    }

    @Bean
    public MessageHandlerMethodFactory myMessageHandlerMethodFactory() {
        DefaultMessageHandlerMethodFactory factory = new DefaultMessageHandlerMethodFactory();
        // factory configuration
        return factory;
    }

    @Bean
    public MyService myService() {
        return new MyService();
    }
}</code></pre><p>   }</p>
<p>Implementing KafkaListenerConfigurer also allows for fine-grained control over endpoints registration via the KafkaListenerEndpointRegistrar. For example, the following configures an extra endpoint:<br>   {<br>       @code<br>       @Configuration<br>       @EnableKafka<br>       public class AppConfig implements KafkaListenerConfigurer {<br>           @Override<br>           public void configureKafkaListeners(KafkaListenerEndpointRegistrar registrar) {<br>               SimpleKafkaListenerEndpoint myEndpoint = new SimpleKafkaListenerEndpoint();<br>               // … configure the endpoint<br>               registrar.registerEndpoint(endpoint, anotherKafkaListenerContainerFactory());<br>           }</p>
<pre><code>    @Bean
    public MyService myService() {
        return new MyService();
    }

    @Bean
    public KafkaListenerContainerFactory&lt;?, ?&gt; anotherKafkaListenerContainerFactory() {
        // ...
    }

    // Kafka infrastructure setup
}</code></pre><p>   }</p>
<p>Note that all beans implementing KafkaListenerConfigurer will be detected and invoked in a similar fashion. The example above can be translated in a regular bean definition registered in the context in case you use the XML configuration.<br>See Also:<br>KafkaListener, KafkaListenerAnnotationBeanPostProcessor, org.springframework.kafka.config.KafkaListenerEndpointRegistrar, org.springframework.kafka.config.KafkaListenerEndpointRegistry<br>  spring-kafka-dist.spring-kafka.main</p>
<h1 id="flush"><a href="#flush" class="headerlink" title="flush"></a>flush</h1><p>If you wish to block the sending thread, to await the result, you can invoke the future’s get() method. You may wish to invoke flush() before waiting or, for convenience, the template has a constructor with an autoFlush parameter which will cause the template to flush() on each send. Note, however that flushing will likely significantly reduce performance.</p>

            <h1 id="What’s-TLS"><a href="#What’s-TLS" class="headerlink" title="What’s TLS"></a>What’s TLS</h1><p>TLS (Transport Layer Security) and its predecessor, SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), are security protocols designed to secure the communication between a server and a client, for example, a web server and a browser. Both protocols are frequently referred to as SSL.</p>
<p>A TLS/SSL certificate (simply called SSL certificate) is required to enable SSL/TLS on your site and serve your website using the secure HTTPS protocol.</p>
<p>We offer different types of domain-validated SSL certificates signed by globally recognized certificate authorities.</p>
<h1 id="CA"><a href="#CA" class="headerlink" title="CA"></a>CA</h1><p>A Certificate Authority (CA) (or Certification Authority) is an entity that issues digital certificates.</p>
<p>The digital certificate <em>certifies the ownership</em> of a public key by the named subject of the certificate. This allows others (relying parties) to rely upon signatures or assertions made by the private key that corresponds to the public key that is certified.</p>
<h1 id="Root-certificate"><a href="#Root-certificate" class="headerlink" title="Root certificate"></a>Root certificate</h1><p>In the SSL ecosystem, anyone can generate a signing key and sign a new certificate with that signature. However, that certificate is not considered valid unless it has been directly or indirectly signed by a trusted CA.</p>
<p>A trusted certificate authority is an entity that has been entitled to verify that someone is effectively who it declares to be. In order for this model to work, all the participants on the game must agree on a set of CA which they trust. All operating systems and most of web browsers ship with a set of trusted CAs.</p>
<p>The SSL ecosystem is based on a * model of trust relationship<em>, also called *</em> “chain of trust” **. When a device validates a certificate, it compares the certificate issuer with the list of trusted CAs. If a match is not found, the client will then check to see if the certificate of the issuing CA was issued by a trusted CA, and so on until the end of the certificate chain. The top of the chain, the root certificate, must be issued by a trusted Certificate Authority.</p>
<h2 id="Tips"><a href="#Tips" class="headerlink" title="Tips"></a>Tips</h2><p>The root certificate is generally embedded in your connected device. In the case of web browsers, root certificates are packaged with the browser software.</p>
<h3 id="To-install-the-Intermediate-SSL-certificates"><a href="#To-install-the-Intermediate-SSL-certificates" class="headerlink" title="To  install the Intermediate SSL certificates?"></a>To  install the Intermediate SSL certificates?</h3><p>The procedure to install the Intermediate SSL certificates depends on the web server and the environment where you install the certificate.</p>
<p>For instance, Apache requires you to bundle the intermediate SSL certificates and assign the location of the bundle to the SSLCertificateChainFile configuration. Conversely, NGINX requires you to package the intermediate SSL certificates in a single bundle with the end-user certificate.</p>
<h1 id="SSL-certificate-chain"><a href="#SSL-certificate-chain" class="headerlink" title="SSL certificate chain"></a>SSL certificate chain</h1><p>There are two types of certificate authorities (CAs): root CAs and intermediate CAs. In order for an SSL certificate to be trusted, that certificate must have been issued by a CA that is included in the trusted store of the device that is connecting.</p>
<p>In this model of trust relationships, a CA is a trusted third party that is trusted by both the subject (owner) of the certificate and the party relying upon the certificate.</p>
<p>In the context of a website, when we use the term digital certificate we often refer to SSL certificates. The CA is the authority responsible for issuing SSL certificates publicly trusted by web browsers.</p>
<p>Anyone can issue SSL certificates, but those certificates would not be trusted automatically by web browsers. Certificates such as these are called self-signed. The CA has the responsibility to validate the entity behind an SSL certificate request and, upon successful validation, the ability to issue publicly trusted SSL certificates that will be accepted by web browsers. Essentially, the browser vendors rely on CAs to validate the entity behind a web site.</p>
<h1 id="How-SSL-work-in-browser"><a href="#How-SSL-work-in-browser" class="headerlink" title="How SSL work in browser"></a>How SSL work in browser</h1><p>There are 3 essential elements at work in the process described above: a protocol for communications (SSL), credentials for establishing identity (the SSL certificate), and a third party that vouches for the credentials (the certificate authority). </p>
<pre><code>Computers use protocols to allow different systems to work together. Web servers and web browsers rely on the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol to enable encrypted communications. The browser’s request that the server identify itself is a function of the SSL protocol.
Credentials for establishing identity are common to our everyday lives: a driver’s license, a passport, a company badge. An SSL certificate is a type of digital certificate that serves as a credential in the online world. Each SSL certificate uniquely identifies a specific domain (such as thawte.com) and a web server.
Our trust of a credential depends on our confidence in the organization that issued it. Certificate authorities have a variety of methods to verify information provided by individuals or organizations. Established certificate authorities, such as Thawte, are well known and trusted by browser vendors. Browsers extend that trust to digital certificates that are verified by the certificate authority.</code></pre><h2 id="PKI"><a href="#PKI" class="headerlink" title="PKI"></a>PKI</h2><p>You are correct that SSL uses an asymmetric key pair. One public and one private key is generated which also known as public key infrastructure (PKI). The public key is what is distributed to the world, and is used to encrypt the data. Only the private key can actually decrypt the data though.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Say we both go to walmart.com and buy stuff. Each of us get a copy of Walmart’s public key to sign our transaction with. Once the transaction is signed by Walmart’s public key, only Walmart’s private key can decrypt the transaction. If I use my copy of Walmart’s public key, it will not decrypt your transaction. Walmart must keep their private key very private and secure, else anyone who gets it can decrypt transactions to Walmart. This is why the DigiNotar breach was such a big deal</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="A-sample-of-how-browser-get-SSL-certificate"><a href="#A-sample-of-how-browser-get-SSL-certificate" class="headerlink" title="A sample of how browser get SSL certificate"></a>A sample of how browser get SSL certificate</h1><p>If I get an SSL certificate from a well-known provider, what does that prove about my site and how?</p>
<p>Here’s what I know:</p>
<pre><code>Assume Alice and Bob both have public and private keys
If Alice encrypts something with Bob&apos;s public key, she ensures that only Bob can decrypt it (using his private key)
If Alice encrypts something with her own private key, anyone can decrypt it (using her public key), but they will know that it was encrypted by her
Therefore, if Alice encrypts a message first with her own private key, then with Bob&apos;s public key, she will ensure that only Bob can decrypt it and that Bob will know the message is from her.</code></pre><p>Regarding certificates, here’s what I think happens (updated):</p>
<pre><code>I generate a request for a certificate. In that request, I put my public key and a bunch of information about myself.
The certificate issuer (in theory) checks me out to make sure it knows who I am: talks to me in person, sees my driver&apos;s license, retina scan, or whatever.
If they&apos;re satisfied, the certificate issuer then encrypts my request with their private key. Anyone who decrypts it with their public key knows that they vouch for the information it contains: they agree that the public key is mine and that the information stated is true about me. This encrypted endorsement is the certificate that they issue to me.
When you connect to my site via https, I send you the certificate.
Your browser already knows the issuer&apos;s public key because your browser came installed with that information.
Your browser uses the issuer&apos;s public key to decrypt what I sent you. The fact that the issuer&apos;s public key works to decrypt it proves that the issuer&apos;s private key was used to encrypt it, and therefore, that the issuer really did create this certificate.
Inside the decrypted information is my public key, which you now know has been vouched for. You use that to encrypt some data to send to me.</code></pre><p>Your key theory: basically right, but authentication is usually done by encrypting a cryptographically secure hash of the data rather than the data itself.</p>
<p>A CA’s signature on an SSL certificate should indicate that the CA has done a certain amount of diligence to ensure that the credentials on the certificate match the owner. That diligence varies, but the ultimate point is that they’re saying that the certificate they signed belongs to the entity named on it.</p>
<p>See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature#Definition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature#Definition</a></p>
<p>A public key certificate is the signed combination between a public key, identifiers, and possibly other attributes. Those who sign this document effectively assert the authenticity of the binding between the public key and the identifier and these attributes, in the same way as a passport issuing authority asserts the binding between the picture and the name in a passport, as various other pieces of information (nationality, date of birth, …).</p>
<pre><code>The private key is used for signing and deciphering/decrypting.
The public key is used for verifying signatures and enciphering/encrypting.</code></pre><p>public key cryptography: A class of cryptographic techniques employing two-key ciphers. Messages encrypted with the public key can only be decrypted with the associated private key. Conversely, messages signed with the private key can be verified with the public key.</p>
<p>It should be pointed out, along with all the other answers, that your private key is not always just one key that is used for both decrypting and signing messages. These should be two separate keys. This would create 4 keys for each person:</p>
<p>Public Encryption Key - Used to encrypt data to send to me.</p>
<p>Private Decryption Key - Used to decrypt messages that were encrypted using my Public Encryption Key.</p>
<p>Private Signing Key - Used to sign messages that I send to other people.</p>
<p>Public Verify Key - Used to verify that a message was, in fact, signed by me.</p>

<p>The file extensions .CRT and .CER are interchangeable.  If your server requires that you use the .CER file extension, you can change the extension by following the steps below:</p>
<pre><code>Double-click on the yourwebsite.crt file to open it into the certificate display.
Select the Details tab, then select the Copy to file button.
Hit Next on the Certificate Wizard.
Select Base-64 encoded X.509 (.CER), then Next.
Select Browse (to locate a destination) and type in the filename yourwebsite.
Hit Save. You now have the file yourwebsite.cer


File extensions for cryptographic certificates aren&apos;t really as standardized as you&apos;d expect. Windows by default treats double-clicking a .crt file as a request to import the certificate into the Windows Root Certificate store, but treats a .cer file as a request just to view the certificate. So, they&apos;re different in that sense, at least, that Windows has some inherent different meaning for what happens when you double click each type of file.</code></pre><p>But the way that Windows handles them when you double-click them is about the only difference between the two. Both extensions just represent that it contains a public certificate. You can rename a file or use one in place of the other in any system or configuration file that I’ve seen. And on non-Windows platforms (and even on Windows), people aren’t particularly careful about which extension they use, and treat them both interchangeably, as there’s no difference between them as long as the contents of the file are correct.</p>
<p>*.pem, *.crt, *.ca-bundle, *.cer, *.p7b, *.p7s files contain one or more X.509 digital certificate files that use base64 (ASCII) encoding. </p>
<p>.DER = The DER extension is used for binary DER encoded certificates. These files may also bear the CER or the CRT extension.   Proper English usage would be “I have a DER encoded certificate” not “I have a DER certificate”.</p>
<p>.PEM = The PEM extension is used for different types of X.509v3 files which contain ASCII (Base64) armored data prefixed with a “—– BEGIN …” line.</p>
<p>.CRT = The CRT extension is used for certificates. The certificates may be encoded as binary DER or as ASCII PEM. The CER and CRT extensions are nearly synonymous.  Most common among *nix systems</p>
<p>CER = alternate form of .crt (Microsoft Convention) You can use MS to convert .crt to .cer (.both DER encoded .cer, or base64[PEM] encoded .cer)  The .cer file extension is also recognized by IE as a command to run a MS cryptoAPI command (specifically rundll32.exe cryptext.dll,CryptExtOpenCER) which displays a dialogue for importing and/or viewing certificate contents.</p>
<p>.KEY = The KEY extension is used both for public and private PKCS#8 keys. The keys may be encoded as binary DER or as ASCII PEM.</p>
<p>The only time CRT and CER can safely be interchanged is when the encoding type can be identical.  (ie  PEM encoded CRT = PEM encoded CER)</p>
<p>What is the SSL Certificate Chain?</p>
<p>There are two types of certificate authorities (CAs): root CAs and intermediate CAs. In order for an SSL certificate to be trusted, that certificate must have been issued by a CA that is included in the trusted store of the device that is connecting.</p>
<p>Good. I see you want to access this particular page.  I need to send the page to you in a secure way. If I<br>encrypt it using my public key, you won’t be able to decrypt it because you don’t have my private key. And since you don’t have any public key of your own that I can use to encrypt the page for you here’s what I propose<br>Since you can send me encrypted messages that only me can read (you have my public key), send me an encrypted message with an encryption key in it. Just make up a random encryption key that we’ll both use to encrypt and decrypt the messages between us during this session . </p>
<p>A simple symmetric key is enought. We’ll use the same key to encrypt and decrypt the messages.</p>
<ul>
<li>So there’s no way that anybody with your public<br>key can trick others to believe that he is you ? </li>
<li>Nope. That’s the beauty of the assymetric encryption. </li>
</ul>
<p>When you send the public key to the victim’s contain your public key + a certificate that this public key belongs to you. If you are a website, then the certificate will contain the domain name of the website. Basically, a certificate says something like:  the following public key “XYZ123” belongs to example.com. </p>
<p>that’s why we have “Certificate Authorities” like Verisign, Digicert or even Symantec. It is believed that these companies have the necessary trustworthiness to deliver certificates to different •entities.<br>Think of a CA like a registrar for public keys. Just like registrars assert that a domain name belongs to a certain person or company, CAS assert that a public key belongs to a certain domain name (or IP address) . </p>
<p>The certificate will contain the CA that delivered it, but you don’t even have to check with them because the certificate is signed by them. That signature alone is enough proof that the certificate comes from them. </p>
<p>A signature is simply a small message that is encrypted with their private key. Since private keys are asymetric, that means that only the associated public key can decrypt it.</p>
<p>Asymmetric encryption works in both way. public -&gt; private and private -&gt; public.<br>What the public key encrypts only the private key can decrypt, and what the private key can encrypt only the public key can decrypt.</p>
<p>for PKI, we’re not looking for secrecy here, we only want to prove that we’ re the real authors of the message. Suppose I send you the message “HELLO WORLD”, encrypted with my private key. The encrypted message would be, for example, “XYZ1234”. So you receive “XYZ1234” . If I give you my public key, you would be able to decrypt “XYZ1234” into “HELLO WORLD” . And by doing so, you would have proof that that message was sent by me, because the public key you used decrypts messages that were encrypted by my private key only. And since I am the only person in the universe who has that private key, that proves that I am the author of that message. </p>
<p>Really nice. So I don’t have to contact the CA to check the validity of the certificate, all I have to do is use their public key to decrypt the signature that’s in it. If it’s the same as err, wait, what should I compare the decrypted signature to again ? </p>
<p>You have to find the same hash as the one you have calculated. They are sending a small hash of the whole certificate. So what you have to do is to calculate the hash of the certificate yourself, then compare it to the hash you get when you decrypt the signature. If the two are the same that means two things </p>
<ol>
<li>The CA’s public key worked, so the signature was encrypted by the associated private key, which means the certificate was really issued by the CA. </li>
<li>Since the hash is the same, it also means that you are seeing the exact same certificate that the CA delivered to the website you are visiting. The information contained inside hasn’t been tampered with. </li>
</ol>
<p>That’s really good. So, let me recap one more time . </p>
<ol>
<li>I contact you for an HTTPS page. </li>
<li>You send me an SSL certificate that contains your public key and a signature from the CA that delivered </li>
<li>I make sure the certificate is valid by using the CA’s public key to decrypt the signature. In parallel, I also calculate the hash of the certificate. </li>
</ol>
<p>If my hash and the one I got from decrypting the signature are equal, that means that the certificate was really issued by the CA and that I can be sure that the public key you sent me is really yours. </p>
<p>Because you implicitly trust the CA.</p>
<p>Let’s continue: </p>
<ol start="4">
<li>I generate a random key that we’ll both use as a symmetric key to encrypt and decrypt the messages we’ll be sending each other. </li>
<li>I encrypt this symmetric key with your public key and send it to you. </li>
<li>You decrypt my message with your private key and find my secret key. </li>
<li>Every request or response between us will be encrypted with this shared secret symmetric key. </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="gpsswd"><a href="#gpsswd" class="headerlink" title="gpsswd"></a>gpsswd</h2><p>DESCRIPTION<br>gpasswd is used to administer the /etc/group file (and /etc/gshadow file if compiled with SHADOWGRP defined). Every group can have administrators, members and a password. System administrator can use -A option to define group administrator(s) and -M option to define members and has all rights of group administrators and members.</p>
<p>Notes about group passwords<br>Group passwords are an inherent security problem since more than one person is permitted to know the password. However, groups are a useful tool for permitting co-operation between different users.</p>
<p>OPTIONS<br>Group administrator can add and delete users using -a and -d options respectively. Administrators can use -r option to remove group password. When no password is set only group members can use newgrp to join the group. Option -R disables access via a password to the group through newgrp command (however members will still be able to switch to this group).</p>
<p>gpasswd called by a group administrator with group name only prompts for the group password. If password is set the members can still newgrp(1) without a password, non-members must supply the password.</p>
<p>FILES<br>Tag    Description<br>/etc/group<br>     Group account information.<br>/etc/gshadow<br>     Secure group account information.</p>

            <h1 id="KDB"><a href="#KDB" class="headerlink" title="KDB"></a>KDB</h1><p>However kdb+ evaluates expressions right-to-left. There are no precedence rules. The reason commonly given for this behaviour is that it is a much simpler to understand system, many q-gods would agree, beginners however may not.</p>
<p>The kdb+ built-in commands are mostly a single letter. If a system command that is not built-in is entered, that command will be passed to the underlying operating system.</p>
<p>Created with financial institutions in mind, the database was developed as a central repository <em>to store time series data</em> that <em>supports real-time analysis of billions of records</em>.</p>
<p>Columnar databases return answers to some queries in a more efficient way than row-based database management systems.</p>
<p>kdb+ dictionaries, tables and nanosecond time stamps are native data types and are used to store time series data.</p>
<p>In 1998, Kx Systems released kdb, a database built on the language K written by Arthur Whitney. In 2003, kdb+ was released as a 64-bit version of kdb.</p>
<p>kdb/q/kdb+ is both a database (kdb) and a vector language (q). It’s used by almost every major financial institution</p>
<p><strong>Kdb+ is an in-memory column-oriented database based on the concept of ordered lists</strong>. In-memory means it primarily stores its data in RAM. This makes it extremely fast with a much simplified database engine but it requires a lot of RAM (Which no longer poses a problem as servers with massive amounts of RAM are now inexpensive). Column oriented database means that each column of data is stored sequentially in memory</p>
<h1 id="Column-DB"><a href="#Column-DB" class="headerlink" title="Column DB"></a>Column DB</h1><p>The main reason why indexes dramatically improve performance on large datasets is that database indexes on one or more columns are typically sorted by value, which makes range queries operations (like the above “find all records with salaries between 40,000 and 50,000” example) very fast (lower time-complexity).</p>
<p>Kdb+ the Database - Column Oriented DB allowing fast timeseries analysis</p>
<h2 id="Column-oriented-systems"><a href="#Column-oriented-systems" class="headerlink" title="Column-oriented systems"></a>Column-oriented systems</h2><p>A column-oriented database serializes all of the values of a column together, then the values of the next column, and so on. For our example table, the data would be stored in this fashion:<br>10:001,12:002,11:003,22:004;<br>Smith:001,Jones:002,Johnson:003,Jones:004;<br>Joe:001,Mary:002,Cathy:003,Bob:004;<br>40000:001,50000:002,44000:003,55000:004;<br>In this layout, any one of the columns more closely matches the structure of an index in a row-based system. This may cause confusion that can lead to the mistaken belief a column-oriented store “is really just” a row-store with an index on every column. However, it is the mapping of the data that differs dramatically. In a row-oriented indexed system, the primary key is the rowid that is mapped from indexed data. In the column-oriented system, the primary key is the data, which is mapped from rowids.[2] This may seem subtle, but the difference can be seen in this common modification to the same store:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…;Smith:001;Jones:002,004;Johnson:003;…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whether or not a column-oriented system will be more efficient in operation depends heavily on the workload being automated. Operations that retrieve all the data for a given object (the entire row) are slower. A row-based system can retrieve the row in a single disk read, whereas numerous disk operations to collect data from multiple columns are required from a columnar database. However, these whole-row operations are generally rare. In the majority of cases, only a limited subset of data is retrieved. In a rolodex application, for instance, collecting the first and last names from many rows to build a list of contacts is far more common than reading all data for any single address. This is even more true for writing data into the database, especially if the data tends to be “sparse” with many optional columns. For this reason, column stores have demonstrated excellent real-world performance in spite of many theoretical disadvantages.</p>
<h2 id="Why-are-most-databases-row-oriented"><a href="#Why-are-most-databases-row-oriented" class="headerlink" title="Why are most databases row-oriented?"></a>Why are most databases row-oriented?</h2><p>Imagine we want to add one row somewhere in the middle of our data for 2011-02-26, on the row oriented database no problem, column oriented we will have to move almost all the data! Lucky since we <code>mostly deal with time series new data only appends to the end</code> of our table.</p>
<h2 id="Difference-vs-row-based-DB"><a href="#Difference-vs-row-based-DB" class="headerlink" title="Difference vs row based DB"></a>Difference vs row based DB</h2><p> a subtle point is that unlike most standard <code>SQL which is based on set theory</code>, <code>kdb+ is based on vectors of ordered lists</code>. Where standard SQL has struggled with queries like find the top 3 stocks by price, find the bottom 3 by market cap because it has no concept of order, kdb’s ordering significantly simplifies many queries. This ordered concept allows kdb+ to provide unique timeseries joins that would be be extremely difficult in other variations of SQL and require the use of slow cursors.</p>
<h1 id="Language-Q"><a href="#Language-Q" class="headerlink" title="Language Q"></a>Language Q</h1><p>the primary design objectives of q are expressiveness, speed and efficiency. In these, it is beyond compare. The design trade-off is a terseness that can be disconcerting to programmers coming from verbose traditional database programming environments – e.g., C++, Java, C# or Python – and a relational DBMS</p>
<p>Q evolved from APL (A Programming Language), which was first invented as a mathematical notation by Kenneth Iverson at Harvard University in the 1950s. APL was introduced in the 1960s by IBM as a vector programming language, meaning that it processes a list of numbers in a single operation. It was successful in finance and other industries that required heavy number crunching.</p>
<p>q is Kx’s proprietary language. It’s a powerful, concise and elegant array language, which means that a production system could just be a single page of code, not pages and pages of code and a nightmare to maintain. Clearly there is an initial investment in learning it, but the power it gives you to manipulate streaming, real-time and historical data makes that initial investment really worthwhile. </p>
<p>q language - fast, interpreted vector based language</p>
<p>Q is a interpreted vector based dynamically typed language built for speed and expressiveness.</p>
<p>Since q is interpreted you can enter commands straight into the console there is no waiting for compilation, feedback is instantaneous. </p>
<h2 id="Key-features-of-Q"><a href="#Key-features-of-Q" class="headerlink" title="Key features of Q"></a>Key features of Q</h2><p>Interpreted Q is interpreted, not compiled. During execution, data and functions live in an in-memory workspace. Iterations of the development cycle tend to be quick because all run-time information needed to test and debug is immediately available in the workspace. Q programs are stored and executed as simple text files called scripts. The interpreter’s eval and parse routines are exposed so that you can dynamically generate code in a controlled manner.</p>
<p>Types Q is a dynamically typed language, in which type checking is mostly unobtrusive. Each variable has the type of its currently assigned value and type promotion is automatic for most numeric operations. Types are checked on operations to homogenous lists.</p>
<p>Evaluation Order While q is entered left-to-right, expressions are evaluated right-to-left or, as the q gods prefer, left of right – meaning that a function is applied to the argument on its right. There is no operator precedence and function application can be written without brackets. Punctuation noise is significantly reduced.</p>
<p>Null and Infinity Values In classical SQL, the value NULL represents missing data for a field of any type and takes no storage space. In q, null values are typed and take the same space as non-nulls. Numeric types also have infinity values. Infinite and null values can participate in arithmetic and other operations with (mostly) predictable results.</p>
<p>Integrated I/O I/O is done through function handles that act as windows to the outside world. Once such a handle is initialized, passing a value to the handle is a write.</p>
<p>Table Oriented Give up objects, ye who enter here. In contrast to traditional languages, you’ll find no classes, objects, inheritance and virtual methods in q. Instead, q has tables as first class entities. The lack of objects is not as severe as might first appear. Objects are essentially glorified records (i.e., entities with named fields), which are modeled by q dictionaries. A table can be viewed as a list of record dictionaries.</p>
<p>Ordered Lists Because classical SQL is the algebra of sets – which are unordered with no duplicates – row order and column order are not defined, making time series processing cumbersome and slow. In q, data structures are based on ordered lists, so time series maintain the order in which they are created. Moreover, simple lists occupy contiguous storage, so processing big data is fast. Very fast.</p>
<p>Column Oriented SQL tables are organized as rows distributed across storage and operations apply to fields within a row. Q tables are column lists in contiguous storage and operations apply on entire columns.</p>
<p>In-Memory Database One can think of kdb+ as an in-memory database with persistent backing. Since data manipulation is performed with q, there is no separate stored procedure language. In fact, kdb+ comprises serialized q column lists written to the file system and then mapped into memory.</p>

<p>Notice in the example code above the absence of loops, no for/while/do yet we could easily express adding one array to another. This is because the vector/list is the primary unit of data in kdb+. Operations are intended to be performed and expressed as being on an entire set of data. Dictionaries can be defined using lists, they provide a hashmap datastructure for quick lookups. Tables are constructed from dictionaries and lists. This brevity of data structures is actually one of the attributes that gives q its ability to express concisely what would take many lines in other languages.</p>
<h1 id="Some-of-the-practical-applications-of-being-able-to-combine-both-streaming-and-real-time-data-together-with-historical-all-in-the-same-database"><a href="#Some-of-the-practical-applications-of-being-able-to-combine-both-streaming-and-real-time-data-together-with-historical-all-in-the-same-database" class="headerlink" title="Some of the practical applications of being able to combine both streaming and real-time data together with historical, all in the same database?"></a>Some of the practical applications of being able to combine both streaming and real-time data together with historical, all in the same database?</h1><p>The most important thing is the simplicity, which translates into speed and ease of doing analysis. For example, it allows you to do complicated, time-critical analysis, such as pre-trade risk. This means that you are likely to see interesting trading opportunities before those who are using the same off-the-shelf solution as everybody else. So you’re there first and you’re there so early, you can afford to do comprehensive pre-trade risk analysis, and you’re able to look for patterns you’ve seen in the past. </p>
<p>In addition to capturing market data, firms are using kdb+ for order-book management, algorithmic trading, and risk assessment. “They are using kdb+/q for queries being performed on both streaming or historical data — the latter easily accommodating research and back-testing,”</p>
<p>DeltaFlow, a platform from First Derivatives that’s based on kdb+, is used by traders for high volume, low-latency algorithmic trading and by regulators for real-time detection of market abuse and unauthorized trading activity across multiple asset classes.</p>
<h1 id="Combined-power-of-kdb-q"><a href="#Combined-power-of-kdb-q" class="headerlink" title="Combined power of kdb+/q"></a>Combined power of kdb+/q</h1><p>What’s beautiful about kdb+ is that since tables are columns of vectors, all the power of the q language can be used as easily on table data as it was on lists. Where we had sum[l],avg[l],weightedAvg[l1;l2] of lists we can write similar qSQL:<br>select avg price, sum volume, weightedAvg[time;price] from trade<br>Want to apply a function to a timeseries, simply place it inline:<br>select {a:avg x; sqrt avg (x<em>x)-a</em>a} price from trade</p>
<h1 id="Q-commadns"><a href="#Q-commadns" class="headerlink" title="Q commadns"></a>Q commadns</h1><p>To obtain official console display of any q value, apply the built-in function show to it.</p>

<h3 id="boolean"><a href="#boolean" class="headerlink" title="boolean"></a>boolean</h3><p>Boolean values in q are stored in a single byte and are denoted as the binary values they really are with an explicit type suffix b. One way to generate boolean values is to test for equality.</p>
<p>q)42=40+2<br>1b</p>
<h3 id="date"><a href="#date" class="headerlink" title="date"></a>date</h3><p>One interesting and useful feature of q temporal values is that, as integral values under the covers, they naturally participate in arithmetic. For example, to advance a date five days, add 5.</p>
<p>q)2000.01.01+5<br>_
Or to advance a time by one microsecond (i.e., 1000 nanoseconds) add 1000.</p>
<p>q)12:00:00.000000000+1000<br>_
Or to verify that temporal values are indeed their underlying values, test for equality.</p>
<p>q)2000.01.01=0</p>
<h3 id="Symbols"><a href="#Symbols" class="headerlink" title="Symbols"></a>Symbols</h3><p>Symbols are denoted by a leading back-quote (called “back tick” in q-speak) followed by characters. Symbols without embedded blanks or other special characters can be entered literally into the console.<br>q)`aapl<br>_</p>
<p>Since symbols are atoms, any two can be tested for equality.</p>
<p>q)<code>aapl=</code>apl<br>_</p>
<h2 id="list"><a href="#list" class="headerlink" title="list"></a>list</h2><p>The fundamental q data structure is a list, which is an ordered collection of items sequenced from left to right. The notation for a general list encloses items with ( and ) and uses ; as separator. Spaces after the semi-colons are optional but can improve readability.</p>
<p>q)(1; 1.2; `one)<br>_</p>
<p>In the case of a homogenous list of atoms, called a simple list, q adopts a simplified format for both storage and display. The parentheses and semicolons are dropped. For example, a list of underlying numeric type separates its items with a space.</p>
<p>q)(1; 2; 3)<br>1 2 3</p>
<p>A simple list of booleans is juxtaposed with no spaces and has a trailing b type indicator.</p>
<p>q)(1b; 0b; 1b)<br>101b<br>A simple list of symbols is displayed with no separating spaces.</p>

<h3 id="basic-operations"><a href="#basic-operations" class="headerlink" title="basic operations"></a>basic operations</h3><p> to construct and manipulate lists. The most fundamental is til, which takes a non-negative integer n and returns the first n integers starting at 0 (n itself is not included in the result).</p>
<p>q)til 10<br>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9</p>
<h4 id="til-list-tips"><a href="#til-list-tips" class="headerlink" title="til list tips"></a>til list tips</h4><p>Be mindful that q always evaluates expressions from right to left and that operations work on vectors whenever possible.</p>
<p>q)1+til 10<br>1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10</p>
<p>Similarly, we obtain the first 10 even numbers and the first ten odd numbers.</p>
<p>q)2<em>til 10<br>_
q)1+2</em>til 10<br>_
Finally, we obtain the first 10 even numbers starting at 42.</p>
<p>q)42+2*til 10<br>_</p>
<p>Another frequently used list primitive is join , that returns the list obtained by concatenating its right operand to its left operand.</p>
<p>q)1 2 3,4 5<br>1 2 3 4 5</p>
<h3 id="extract"><a href="#extract" class="headerlink" title="extract"></a>extract</h3><p>To extract items from the front or back of a list, use the take operator #. Positive argument means take from the front, negative from the back.</p>
<p>q)2#til 10<br>0 1<br>q)-2#til 10 </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Applying # always results in a list.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In particular, the idiom 0# returns an empty list of the same type as the first item in its argument. Using an atom argument is a succinct way to create a typed empty list of the type of the atom.</p>
<p>q)0#1 2 3<br>`long$()</p>
<p>Should you extract more items than there are in the list, # restarts at the beginning and continues extracting. It does this until the specified number of items is reached.</p>
<p>q)5#1 2 3<br>1 2 3 1 2</p>
<p>As with atoms, a list can be assigned to a variable.</p>
<p>q)L:10 20 30<br>The items of a list can be accessed via indexing, which uses square brackets and is relative to 0.</p>
<p>q)L[0]<br>10</p>
<h3 id="Function"><a href="#Function" class="headerlink" title="Function"></a>Function</h3><p>Conceptually, a q function is a sequence of steps that produces an output result from an input value. Since q is not purely functional, these rules can interact with the world by reaching outside the context of the function. Such actions are called side effects and should be carefully controlled.</p>
<p>Function definition is delimited by matching curly braces { and }. Immediately after the opening brace, the formal parameters are names enclosed in square brackets [ and ] and separated by semi-colons. These parameters presumably appear in the body of the function, which follows the formal parameters and is a succession of expressions sequenced by semi-colons.</p>
<p>Following is a simple function that returns the square of its input. On the next line we assign the same function to the variable sq. The whitespace is optional.</p>
<p>q){[x] x<em>x}<br>_
q)sq:{[x] x</em>x}<br>_</p>
<p>Here is a function that takes two input values and returns the sum of their squares.</p>
<p>q){[x;y] a:x<em>x; b:y</em>y; a+b}<br>_
q)pyth:{[x;y] a:x<em>x; b:y</em>y; a+b}<br>_</p>
<p>Here are the previous functions applied to arguments.</p>
<p>q){[x] x<em>x}[5]<br>25<br>q)sq[5]<br>_
q){[x;y] a:x</em>x; b:y*y; a+b}[3;4]<br>25<br>q)pyth[3;4]<br>_</p>
<h3 id="monadic-function"><a href="#monadic-function" class="headerlink" title="monadic function"></a>monadic function</h3><p>In q, as in most functional languages, we don’t need no stinkin’ brackets for application of a monadic function – i.e., with one parameter. Simply separate the function from its argument by whitespace. This is called function juxtaposition.</p>
<p>q){x<em>x} 5<br>_
q)f:{x</em>x}<br>q)f 5<br>_</p>
<h3 id="x-y-z"><a href="#x-y-z" class="headerlink" title="x,y,z"></a>x,y,z</h3><p>It is common in mathematics to use function parameters x, y, or z. If you are content with these names (in the belief that descriptive names provide no useful information to the poor soul reading your code), you can omit their declaration and q will understand that you mean the implicit parameters x, y, and z in that order.</p>
<p>q){x<em>x}[5]<br>25<br>q){a:x</em>x; b:y*y; a+b}[3;4]<br>25</p>
<h3 id="verbs"><a href="#verbs" class="headerlink" title="verbs"></a>verbs</h3><p>higher order functions, or as they are called in q, adverbs. </p>
<p>In words, we tell q to start with the initial value of 0 in the accumulator and then modify + with the adverb / so that it adds across the list.</p>
<p>q)0 +/ 1 2 3 4 5<br>15</p>
<p>In this situation we don’t really need the flexibility to specify the initial value of the accumulator. It suffices to start with the first item of the list and proceed across the rest of the list. There is an even simpler form for this case.</p>
<p>q)(+/) 1 2 3 4 5</p>
<h4 id="for-loop"><a href="#for-loop" class="headerlink" title="for loop"></a>for loop</h4><p>If you are new to functional programming, you may think, “Big deal, I write for loops in my sleep.” </p>
<p>More importantly, you can focus on what you want done without the irrelevant scaffolding of how to set up control structures. This is called declarative programming.</p>
<p>What else can we do with our newfound adverb? Change addition to multiplication for factorial.</p>

<h3 id="larger-vs-smaller"><a href="#larger-vs-smaller" class="headerlink" title="larger vs smaller"></a>larger vs smaller</h3><p>The fun isn’t limited to arithmetic primitives. We introduce |, which returns the larger of its operands and &amp;, which returns the smaller of its operands.</p>

q)max 20 10 40 30<br>_
q)min 20 10 40 30 </p>
<p>At this point the / pattern should be clear: it takes a given function and produces a new function that accumulates across the original list, producing a single result. In particular, / converts a dyadic function to a monadic aggregate function – i.e., one that collapses a list to an atom.</p>
<h1 id="data-type"><a href="#data-type" class="headerlink" title="data type"></a>data type</h1><p>long¶</p>
<p>In q versions 3.0 and later, the basic integer type is a signed eight-byte integer, called long. A literal is identified as a long by the fact that it contains only numeric digits, with an optional leading minus sign, and no decimal point. It may also have an optional trailing type indicator j indicating it is a long and not another integer type. Here is a typical long integer value.</p>
<p>q)42<br>42<br>Observe that the type indicator j is accepted but redundant.</p>
<p>q)42j<br>42</p>
<p>The short type represents a two-byte signed integer and requires the trailing type indicator h. For example,</p>
<p>q)-123h<br>_
Similarly, the int type represents a four-byte signed integer and requires the trailing type indicator i.</p>
<p>The float type represents an IEEE standard eight-byte floating-point number, often called “double” in traditional languages. A float can hold (at least) 15 decimal digits of precision. It is denoted by optionally signed numeric digits with either a decimal point or an optional trailing type indicator f. Observe that the console shortens the display of floats with no significant digits to the right of the decimal.</p>
<p>You can change this by using the \P command (note upper case) to specify a display width up to 16 digits. If you issue \P 0 the console will display all 17 decimal digits of the underlying binary representation, although the last digit is unreliable.</p>
<p>boolean¶</p>
<p>The boolean type uses one byte to store a bit and is denoted by the bit value with the trailing type indicator b. There are no keywords for ‘true’ or ‘false’, nor are there separate logical operators for booleans.</p>
<p>q)0b<br>_
q)1b</p>
<p>Text Data¶</p>
<p>There are two atomic text types in q. They are more akin to the SQL types CHAR and VARCHAR than the character types of traditional languages.</p>
<p>2.4.1 char¶</p>
<p>A char holds an individual ASCII or 8-bit Unicode character that is stored in one byte. It corresponds to a SQL CHAR. It is denoted by a single character enclosed in double quotes.</p>
<p>q)”q”</p>
<p>Some keyboard characters – e.g., the double-quote – cannot be entered directly into a char since they have special meaning in the q console. As in C, special characters are escaped with a preceding back-slash . The console display somewhat confusingly displays the escape, but the following are all actually single characters.</p>
<p>q)”&quot;“ 
“&quot;“
q)”\“ 
_
q)”\n”<br>_
q)”\r”<br>_
q)”\t”<br>_
Also as in C, you can escape any ASCII character by specifying its underlying numeric value as three octal digits.</p>
<p>q)”\142”<br>“b”</p>
<p>symbol¶</p>
<p>A symbol is an atom holding text. It is denoted by a leading back-quote, read “back tick” in q-speak.</p>
<p>q)<code>q
_
q)</code>zaphod<br>_</p>
<p>a symbol is not a collection of char. The symbol `a and the char “a” are not the same, as we can see by asking q if they are identical.</p>
<p>q)`a~”a”<br>0b</p>
<h1 id="list-1"><a href="#list-1" class="headerlink" title="list"></a>list</h1><h2 id="Index-Notation¶"><a href="#Index-Notation¶" class="headerlink" title="Index Notation¶"></a>Index Notation¶</h2><p>To access the item at index i in a list, follow the list immediately with [i]. This is called item indexing. For example,</p>
<p>q)(100; 200; 300)[0]</p>
<p> Indexed Assignment¶</p>
<p>Items in a list can also be assigned via item indexing. Thus,</p>
<p>q)L:1 2 3<br>q)L[1]:42<br>q)L<br>1 42 3</p>
<p>An omitted index returns the entire list.</p>
<p>q)L:10 20 30 40<br>q)L[]<br>10 20 30 40</p>
