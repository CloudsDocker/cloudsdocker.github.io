## Frame in Swift

Forgetting to assign a view a frame when creating it in code, and then wondering why it isnâ€™t appearing when added to a superview, is a common beginner mistake. If a view has a standard size that you want it to adopt, especially in relation to its contents (like a UIButton in relation to its title), an alternative is to call its sizeToFit method.
