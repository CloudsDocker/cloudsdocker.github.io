<p>DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market.</p>
<p><img src="http://cloudsdocker.github.io/images/DevOps.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="whats-means-to-team">What&rsquo;s means to team</h2>
<p>These two teams are merged into a single team where the engineers work across the entire application lifecycle, from development and test to deployment to operations, and develop a range of skills not limited to a single function.</p>
<h2 id="devsecops">DevSecOps</h2>
<p>In some DevOps models, quality assurance and security teams may also become more tightly integrated with development and operations and throughout the application lifecycle. When security is the focus of everyone on a DevOps team, this is sometimes referred to as DevSecOps.</p>
<h1 id="benefits">Benefits</h1>
<ul>
<li>Velocity: microservices and continuous delivery let teams take ownership of services and then release updates to them quicker.</li>
<li>Reliablity: CI, CD, automated testing</li>
<li>Governmence:  using infrastructure as code and policy as code, you can define and then track compliance at scale.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mindset">mindset</h2>
<p>DevOps Cultural Philosophy
Transitioning to DevOps requires a change in culture and mindset. At its simplest, DevOps is about removing the barriers between two traditionally siloed teams, development and operations. In some organizations, there may not even be separate development and operations teams; engineers may do both.</p>
<h1 id="practice">Practice</h1>
<h2 id="very-frequent-but-small-release">very frequent but small release</h2>
<p>One fundamental practice is to perform very frequent but small updates. This is how organizations innovate faster for their customers. These updates are usually more incremental in nature than the occasional updates performed under traditional release practices. Frequent but small updates make each deployment less risky. They help teams address bugs faster because teams can identify the last deployment that caused the error.</p>
<h2 id="microservices">microservices</h2>
<p>use a microservices architecture to make their applications more flexible and enable quicker innovation.This architecture reduces the coordination overhead of updating applications, and when each service is paired with small, agile teams who take ownership of each service, organizations can move more quickly.</p>
<h1 id="tech-concepts">Tech Concepts</h1>
<h2 id="continuous-integration">Continuous Integration</h2>
<p>Continuous integration is a software development practice where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, after which automated builds and tests are run. The key goals of continuous integration are to find and address bugs quicker, improve software quality, and reduce the time it takes to validate and release new software updates.</p>
<h2 id="continuous-delivery">Continuous Delivery</h2>
<p>Continuous delivery is a software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for a release to production. <code>It expands upon continuous integration by deploying all code changes to a testing environment and/or a production environment after the build stage</code>. When continuous delivery is implemented properly, developers will always have a deployment-ready build artifact that has passed through a standardized test process.</p>
<h2 id="monitoring-and-logging">Monitoring and Logging</h2>
<p>Organizations monitor metrics and logs to see how application and infrastructure performance impacts the experience of their product’s end user. By capturing, categorizing, and then analyzing data and logs generated by applications and infrastructure, organizations understand how changes or updates impact users, shedding insights into the root causes of problems or unexpected changes. Active monitoring becomes increasingly important as services must be available 24/7 and as application and infrastructure update frequency increases. Creating alerts or performing real-time analysis of this data also helps organizations more proactively monitor their services.</p>
<h2 id="communication-and-collaboration">Communication and Collaboration</h2>
<p>Increased communication and collaboration in an organization is one of the key cultural aspects of DevOps. The use of DevOps tooling and automation of the software delivery process establishes collaboration by physically bringing together the workflows and responsibilities of development and operations.</p>
