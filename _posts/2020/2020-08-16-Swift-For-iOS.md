This book is intended to accompany and precede Programming iOS 13, which picks up where this book leaves off. If writing an iOS program is like building a house of bricks, this book teaches you what a brick is and how to handle it, while Program‚Äê ming iOS 13 shows you some actual bricks and tells you how to assemble them.
