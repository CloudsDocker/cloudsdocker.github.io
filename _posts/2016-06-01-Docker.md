# Dockers Concepts

## Official Definition

> Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build,ship and run distributed applications

>Docker's philosophy is "build->ship->run".

In contemporary IT industry, there are two major usage of `Docker`.

1. Focus on Build & Ship, to leverage Docker to setup a platform of "CI/CD", for develop, test enviornment.
1. Make use of Docker as light weight VM (virtual machine), focus on `Run`, apply it in large scale production environment.

# ACL

the access control in docker is rely on iptables, the firewall software shipped in almost all Linux release.

# Sample Commands
List all images
```sh
docker images
```

```sh
sudo docker version
```

## remove all exited containers
docker rm $(docker ps -a -f status=exited -q)

## Run 
```sh
docker run IMAGE_NAME [COMMAND] # run a command in new container
docker run -t -i f2d8ce9fa988 /bin/bash # run bash in console and interactive mode
```
## View docker details, e.g. start up script, working dir
```sh
docker inspect containerid
```

## Start bash to view files inside docker
```sh
docker -t -i imageFile /bin/bash
```

## Map hosts between host and contains
```sh
docker -P xxx
docker ps -l
```
You'll see
```sh
0.0.0.0:32768->5000/tcp   
```
It means host port 32768 map to port 5000 in contains

## To list docker containers including histories
```sh
docker ps -a # show all containers instead of only running as default
docker ps -l # show latest created container
```

# removes containers once return from one run
```sh
docker run --rm -name myApp1  -link  db:db training/webapp env
```

## to ping other containers
Be advised there is no built-in ping for containers, therefore it's requried manually install one. As following sample:
```sh
apt-get install -yqq inetutils-ping
```
