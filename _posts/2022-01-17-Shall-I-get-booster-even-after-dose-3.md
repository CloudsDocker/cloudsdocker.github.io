# Background
Omicron COVID-19 is spreading around the world like wildfire, it is driving COVID-19 case numbers to new highs with worldwide infections hitting new and new recording cases per day. 

# Why booster or 3rd does
After many of us finished two doses of vaccination, some governments ask citizens to arrange booster/does 3, as its rollout comes amid concern about the spread of the Omicron variant. 

However, due to lack of clear explanations some citizens get confused of this. Furthermore, someone just finished does 3 Pfizer but was told does 3 is different to booster, you should go for booster does as well. Is it true? Let's find it out.

# What's difference between Booster and does 3.
From the documents opened by CDC, there are no difference of those two.

## Dose 3 (Additional primary dose)

# I've taken 3rd dose, do I still need booster?

The short answer is `depends`. If you are Immunocompromised, you should take both. Otherwise, e.g. for most normal people, `dose 3 is same as booster`, if you've already done dose 3, no need to take booster dose. This is the answer confirmed by a certificated General Practice (GP).

# How do I know I'm Immunocompromised?

People are considered to be moderately or severely immunocompromised if they have:

 - Been receiving active cancer treatment for tumours or cancers of the blood
 - Received an organ transplant and are taking medicine to suppress the immune system
 - Received a stem cell transplant within the last 2 years or are taking medicine to suppress the immune system
 - Moderate or severe primary immunodeficiency (such as DiGeorge syndrome, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome)
 - Advanced or untreated HIV infection
 - Active treatment with high-dose corticosteroids or other drugs that may suppress your immune response

# Most importantly
Any questions or queries, check with your GP or see doctors. Healthy is most important.
