# Scala String

Scala offers the magic of implicit conver‐ sions, String instances also have access to all the methods of the StringOps class, so you can do many other things with them, such as treating a String instance as a sequence of characters. As a result, you can iterate over every character in the string using the foreach method:
```java
scala> "hello".foreach(println) h
e
l
l o
//You can treat a String as a sequence of characters in a for loop:
scala> for (c <- "hello") println(c)

scala> val result = "hello world".filter(_ != 'l') result: String = heo word
```
