## Differences between not in, not exists , and left join with null

> It seems to me that you can do the same thing in a SQL query using either NOT EXISTS, NOT IN, or LEFT JOIN WHERE IS NULL. For example:

```sh
SELECT a FROM table1 WHERE a NOT IN (SELECT a FROM table2)
SELECT a FROM table1 WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM table2 WHERE table1.a = table2.a)
SELECT a FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 ON table1.a = table2.a WHERE table1.a IS NULL
```

I'm not sure if I got all the syntax correct, but these are the general techniques I've seen. Why would I choose to use one over the other? Does performance differ...? Which one of these is the fastest / most efficient? (If it depends on implementation, when would I use each one?)

## answer

In a nutshell:

NOT IN is a little bit different: it never matches if there is but a single NULL in the list.

In MySQL, NOT EXISTS is a little bit less efficient

In SQL Server, LEFT JOIN / IS NULL is less efficient

In PostgreSQL, NOT IN is less efficient

In Oracle, all three methods are the same.
