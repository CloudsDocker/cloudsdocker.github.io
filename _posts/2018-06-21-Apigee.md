App deployment, configuration management and orchestration - all from one system. Ansible is powerful IT automation that you can learn quickly.

# Architecture
APIs are the glue that connect apps and act as the foundation for what we call the digital economy. Through every connection there is at least one API interacting with other applications and exchanging data. A business needs API management solutions that can support diverse users and not compromise the stability and reliability of back-end systems. Apigees intelligent API management platform allows companies to provide connected, seamless, digital experiences and increase the speed at which they innovate and adapt.

# Apigee Edge, Apigee's API Management platform, provides a unified solution that:

makes your APIs fail-proof
helps you grow your developer and partner ecosystem
enables you to run your APIs at scale
provides deep insights into your APIs and your business
Apigee Edge is the API management tool that offers the solutions today's digital economy demands. For more information, download our Definitive Guide to API Management.

## Build RESTful APIs
You have data, you have services, and you want to develop new business solutions quickly, both internally and externally.

With Apigee, you can build API proxies—RESTful, HTTP-based APIs that interact with your services. With easy-to-use APIs, developers can be more productive, increasing your speed to market.

API proxies give you the full power of Apigee's API platform to secure API calls, throttle traffic, mediate messages, control error handling, cache things, build developer portals, document APIs, analyze API traffic data, make money on the use of your APIs, protect against bad bots, and more.

## Configuration management
Ansible configurations are simple data descriptions of your infrastructure (both human-readable and machine-parsable) - ensuring everyone on your team will be able to understand the meaning of each configuration task. New team members will be able to quickly dive in and make an impact. Existing team members can get work done faster - freeing up cycles to attend to more critical and strategic work instead of configuration management.


Ansible requires nothing more than a password or SSH key in order to start managing systems and can start managing them without installing any agent software, avoiding the problem of "managing the management" common in many automation systems. There's no more wondering why configuration management daemons are down, when to upgrade management agents, or when to patch security vulnerabilities in those agents.

### GOAL-ORIENTED, NOT SCRIPTED
Ansible features an state-driven resource model that describes the desired state of computer systems and services, not the paths to get them to this state. No matter what state a system is in, Ansible understands how to transform it to the desired state (and also supports a "dry run" mode to preview needed changes). This allows reliable and repeatable IT infrastructure configuration, avoiding the potential failures from scripting and script-based solutions that describe explicit and often irreversible actions rather than the end goal.


### SECURE & AGENTLESS
Ansible relies on the most secure remote configuration management system available as its default transport layer: OpenSSH. OpenSSH is available for a wide variety of platforms, is very lightweight and when security issues in OpenSSH are discovered, they are patched quickly.

Further, Ansible does not require any remote agents. Ansible delivers all modules to remote systems and executes tasks, as needed, to enact the desired configuration. These modules run with user-supplied credentials, including support for sudo and even Kerberos and clean up after themselves when complete. Ansible does not require root login privileges, specific SSH keys, or dedicated users and respects the security model of the system under management.

As a result, Ansible has a very low attack surface area and is quite easy to deploy into new environments.

## EFFICIENT ARCHITECTURE
Ansible works by connecting to your nodes and pushing out small programs, called "Ansible modules" to them. These programs are written to be resource models of the desired state of the system. Ansible then executes these modules (over SSH by default), and removes them when finished.

Your library of modules can reside on any machine, and there are no servers, daemons, or databases required. Typically you'll work with your favorite terminal program, a text editor, and probably a version control system to keep track of changes to your content.

# MANAGE YOUR INVENTORY IN SIMPLE TEXT FILES

By default, Ansible represents what machines it manages using a very simple INI file that puts all of your managed machines in groups of your own choosing.  

To add new machines, there is no additional SSL signing server involved, so there's never any hassle deciding why a particular machine didn’t get linked up due to obscure NTP or DNS issues.

```bash
[webservers]
www1.example.com
www2.example.com

[dbservers]
db0.example.com
db1.example.com
```

## installation
Once Ansible is installed, it will not add a database, and there will be no daemons to start or keep running. You only need to install it on one machine (which could easily be a laptop) and it can manage an entire fleet of remote machines from that central point. When Ansible manages remote machines, it does not leave software installed or running on them, so there’s no real question about how to upgrade Ansible when moving to a new version.
