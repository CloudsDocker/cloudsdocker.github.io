# Intellij Sometimes crash compaling some error such auto generated MapStruct class not found or Kotlin class not found

This is may be because of the IntelliJ cache, so you can try to invalidate the cache and restart the IntelliJ.

The simplest way to do this is to click on the File menu and select the Invalidate Caches / Restart option. This will bring up a dialog box with the option to invalidate the caches, restart the IDE, or both. Click on the Invalidate and Restart button to clear the cache and restart IntelliJ IDEA.
