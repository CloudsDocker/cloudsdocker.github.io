# Unraveling the Mystery of Nested SQL Comments in VS Code
Have you ever found yourself staring at a sea of incorrectly highlighted SQL code in Visual Studio Code, wondering why your perfectly valid Teradata SQL looks like a comment apocalypse? Fear not, fellow developers! Today, we're diving deep into the rabbit hole of nested comments and emerging victorious with a solution that will make your SQL shine again.
The Curious Case of the Runaway Comments
Picture this: You're working on a complex SQL script, nested comments abound, and suddenly, VS Code decides to paint everything in the muted tones of a comment. Your perfectly crafted INSERT statements are treated as mere whispers in the wind, lost in a sea of green. What's a developer to do?
This, my friends, is the notorious nested comment conundrum. It's like Russian nesting dolls, but with far less charm and a lot more frustration.
The Heart of the Matter
At the core of this issue lies the TextMate grammar that VS Code uses for SQL syntax highlighting. It's like the DNA of our code's appearance, dictating what should be bold, what should be italic, and what should be hidden away as a comment.
Let's take a peek at the culprit:
jsonCopy"comment-block": {
    "begin": "/\\*",
    "captures": {
        "0": {
            "name": "punctuation.definition.comment.sql"
        }
    },
    "end": "\\*/",
    "name": "comment.block",
    "patterns": [
        {
            "include": "#comment-block"
        }
    ]
}
See that innocent-looking "include": "#comment-block"? It's like a mirror facing another mirror, creating an infinite reflection that confuses our poor VS Code.
The Elegant Solution
Now, prepare to be amazed by the simplicity of the fix. Are you ready? Drumroll, please...
We simply remove the recursive pattern! Here's the sleek, streamlined version that brings peace to our SQL kingdom:
jsonCopy{
    "begin": "/\\*",
    "captures": {
        "0": {
            "name": "punctuation.definition.comment.sql"
        }
    },
    "end": "\\*/",
    "name": "comment.block"
}
Voil√†! No more infinite comment loops. No more SQL masquerading as commentary. Just pure, properly highlighted code.
The "Why" Behind the Magic
You might be wondering, "Why does this work?" Well, imagine you're at a party (stay with me here). The old grammar was like telling someone, "If you see a person, tell them to look for another person, who should look for another person, and so on." Eventually, everyone's just looking for people and nobody's enjoying the party!
Our new grammar simply says, "If you see a comment start, highlight everything until you see a comment end." Simple, efficient, and it doesn't get lost in its own instructions.
Implementing the Fix

Locate your sql.tmLanguage.json file. It's usually hiding in the VS Code extensions folder, playing hard to get.
Find the repository section, and within it, the comments patterns.
Replace the old comment-block with our svelte new version.
Save the file, restart VS Code, and watch your SQL code burst into vibrant, correctly highlighted life!

The Bigger Picture
This journey teaches us a valuable lesson: sometimes, the most elegant solutions are also the simplest. In our complex world of nested functions, recursive algorithms, and intricate code structures, it's refreshing to solve a problem by removing complexity rather than adding it.
Wrapping Up
As we close this chapter in our SQL syntax highlighting saga, remember: every bug is an opportunity for improvement, every error a chance to learn. Keep questioning, keep exploring, and most importantly, keep your comments un-nested (unless you really, really need to)!
Happy coding, and may your SQL always be perfectly highlighted!
