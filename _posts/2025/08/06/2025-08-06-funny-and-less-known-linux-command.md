# 14 Linux Command-Line Tricks That Will Make You Feel Like a Power User ðŸš€

If you spend any time in the terminal, you know thereâ€™s always something new to learn. Whether youâ€™re a developer, sysadmin, or just a curious tinkerer, mastering a few clever Linux commands can save you hours and make you look like a wizard to your peers. Here are 14 practical, sometimes surprising, and always useful command-line tricks that will level up your Linux game!

## 1. Quickly Serve Any Directory Over HTTP

Ever needed to share files with a colleague or test a static website? You can spin up a web server in seconds:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```
Just point your browser to `http://localhost:8080` and youâ€™re live!

---

## 2. Find the 10 Largest Files in a Directory Tree

Running out of disk space? Find the culprits fast:

```bash
find . -type f -exec du -h {} + | sort -rh | head -n 10
```
This command lists the 10 biggest files, sorted by size, so you know what to clean up.

---

## 3. Show Running Processes as a Tree

Visualize process relationships with:

```bash
pstree -p
```
Itâ€™s like a family tree for your running programs!

---

## 4. Repeat the Last Command with `sudo`

Typed a command and forgot `sudo`? No need to retype:

```bash
sudo !!
```
This reruns your last command with superuser privileges.

---

## 5. Show Only Directories (Not Files)

Want a clean list of just directories?

```bash
ls -d */
```
Perfect for scripting or just keeping things tidy.

---

## 6. Count Files by Extension

How many Python files are in your project?

```bash
find . -type f -name "*.py" | wc -l
```
Swap out `*.py` for any extension you like.

---

## 7. Find and Delete Empty Files

Clear out those zero-byte files:

```bash
find . -type f -empty -delete
```
A quick way to keep your workspace clean.

---

## 8. Monitor File Changes in Real Time

Watch logs or any file as it grows:

```bash
tail -f /var/log/syslog
```
Great for debugging or monitoring.

---

## 9. Show Top Memory or CPU Consuming Processes

Find resource hogs instantly:

```bash
ps aux --sort=-%mem | head -n 11   # Top memory users
ps aux --sort=-%cpu | head -n 11   # Top CPU users
```

---

## 10. Find Files Modified Recently

Track down whatâ€™s changed in the last hour or day:

```bash
find . -type f -mmin -60      # Modified in last 60 minutes
find . -type f -mtime -1      # Modified in last 1 day
```

---

## 11. Get Your Public IP Address

Need to know your external IP?

```bash
curl ifconfig.me
```
Or try `curl -s https://ipinfo.io/ip` for another source.

---

## 12. Show All Open Network Ports

See whatâ€™s listening on your system:

```bash
sudo ss -tulnp
```
A modern replacement for `netstat`.

---

## 13. Find and Replace Text Recursively

Bulk update text across many files:

```bash
grep -rl "oldtext" . | xargs sed -i 's/oldtext/newtext/g'
```
Be carefulâ€”this is powerful!

---

## 14. Generate a Random Password

Need a strong password in a pinch?

```bash
openssl rand -base64 16
```
Instant, secure, and ready to use.

---

## Bonus: Combine Commands for Superpowers

Want to find all `.azw3` files and get their total size?

```bash
find . -type f -name "*.azw3" -exec du -ch {} + | grep total$
```
This gives you a neat summary at the end.
