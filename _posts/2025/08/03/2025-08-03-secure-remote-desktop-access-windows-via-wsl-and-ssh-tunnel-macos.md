## üîí Why SSH Tunnel + RDP?

When you're working across devices ‚Äî say, developing on a **MacBook** while occasionally needing full GUI access to a **Windows machine** ‚Äî you might default to enabling RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) and opening it to the world. **Don‚Äôt.**
Instead, **SSH tunneling** gives you an encrypted, firewall-friendly way to access your Windows desktop ‚Äî without exposing the RDP port (3389) to the internet.

In this guide, I‚Äôll walk you through a practical use case: I‚Äôm on a **MacBook**, and I want to connect to a **Windows 11 machine**, securely, by tunneling through its **WSL2 (Ubuntu)** instance ‚Äî where I already have SSH access.

---

## üß± System Architecture Overview

Here‚Äôs what we're building:

```
MacBook (Microsoft Remote Desktop)
        |
        |  SSH (Port 8222) with Tunnel
        v
Remote Host (Windows 11 + WSL2 Ubuntu)
        |
        |  Forwarded RDP traffic (port 3389)
        v
Windows Desktop (via 127.0.0.1:3389)
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Components Explained

### ‚úÖ SSH Tunnel

An **SSH tunnel** securely forwards local ports to a remote host over an encrypted channel. Think of it as a VPN-like pipe ‚Äî but lighter, and easier to manage.

```bash
ssh -L local_port:remote_host:remote_port user@remote -p port
```

In our case:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_aidrapc_macpro -p 8222 \
  -L 3390:172.30.192.1:3389 phray@121.209.151.71
```

This opens an SSH session into WSL and creates a tunnel from `localhost:3390` (on Mac) to `Windows:3389` (RDP).

---

### ‚úÖ Windows RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)

RDP is the native Microsoft remote desktop solution. It runs on port `3389` and allows full GUI access. But exposing it directly to the internet is dangerous.

### ‚úÖ WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

WSL allows Linux to run on Windows natively. We use it as a secure landing pad: we connect to WSL over SSH, and from there access Windows resources.

---

## üß™ The Problem: Tunnel Worked, But RDP Hung

After successfully running:

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_aidrapc_macpro -p 8222 -L 3390:172.30.192.1:3389 phray@121.209.151.71
```

And opening **Microsoft Remote Desktop** on macOS with:

* **PC name**: `localhost:3390`
* **User**: my Windows credentials

‚Ä¶I was stuck on *"Connecting..."* forever. üòí

---

## üîç Troubleshooting Steps

### 1. ‚úÖ SSH Tunnel Verified

If you see the Ubuntu login welcome message (`Welcome to Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS`), your tunnel is alive. So the issue isn‚Äôt SSH.

### 2. ‚ùå No Response from RDP

I ran this inside the WSL terminal:

```bash
nc -zv 172.30.192.1 3389
```

Got nothing ‚Äî not even a timeout error. That told me the **Windows RDP port wasn‚Äôt reachable from WSL**.

---

## üßØ Fixing the Root Cause

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Enable RDP in Windows

Go to:

```
Settings ‚Üí System ‚Üí Remote Desktop ‚Üí Enable Remote Desktop
```

Ensure it‚Äôs **enabled** and the current user is allowed to connect.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Open RDP Port in Windows Firewall

Run the following in **PowerShell (Admin)**:

```powershell
Enable-NetFirewallRule -DisplayGroup "Remote Desktop"
```

This opens all required rules for local and remote RDP connections.

---

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Confirm Windows IP from WSL

Run inside WSL:

```bash
cat /etc/resolv.conf
```

You‚Äôll typically see:

```
nameserver 172.30.192.1
```

This IP is your **Windows host**, from the WSL perspective.

Now run:

```bash
nc -zv 172.30.192.1 3389
```

If you see:

```
Connection to 172.30.192.1 3389 port [tcp/ms-wbt-server] succeeded!
```

You‚Äôre good to go!

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Final RDP Setup on macOS

1. Launch **Microsoft Remote Desktop**.
2. Add a new PC with:

   * **PC Name**: `127.0.0.1:3390`
   * **Username/Password**: your Windows credentials (not WSL).
3. Connect and enjoy full Windows desktop in a secure tunnel!

---

## üí° Bonus: Run Tunnel in Background

To avoid an open terminal window, use:

```bash
ssh -fN -i ~/.ssh/id_aidrapc_macpro -p 8222 -L 3390:172.30.192.1:3389 phray@121.209.151.71
```

* `-f`: run in background
* `-N`: don‚Äôt execute remote commands

## üß† What You (Should) Learn

| Concept         | Why it matters                                            |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| SSH Tunnel      | Encrypts traffic, avoids open firewall ports              |
| WSL             | Useful Linux shell on Windows, great for DevOps workflows |
| RDP             | Standard GUI remote access on Windows                     |
| Port forwarding | Foundation of secure remote system access                 |

## üèÅ Final Thoughts

This method is **safer than directly exposing RDP**, requires minimal setup, and works beautifully when configured correctly. And if you're like me ‚Äî working across platforms and valuing security ‚Äî it's a great daily-driver tool to have in your pocket.

Let me know in the comments ‚Äî do you tunnel into your machines like this? Any clever tricks or failures you‚Äôve learned from?
