A debt security represents a debt owed by the issuer to an investor. Here, the investor acts as a lender to the issuer which may be a government, organisation or company. However, unlike other types of debt such as bank loans, debt securities are generally tradable â€“ that is, can be bought or sold between parties in the market prior to maturity.
