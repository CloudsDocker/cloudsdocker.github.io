`RAID` is Reductant Array Independent Disk, 

# JBOD
`JBOD` is abbreviated from "Just a bunch of disks", is an architecutre using multiple hard drives, but not in a RAID configuration, thus providing neither redundancy nor performance improvement.Hard drives may be handled independently as separate logical volumnes, or they may be combined into a single logical volume using a volume manager like LVM, such volumes are usually called "spanned"

# LVM
'LVM' means Logical Volume Manager, is part of Linux kenel, is a device mapper. LVM is used to manage large hard disk farms by allowing disks to be added and replaced without downtime or service distruption.
