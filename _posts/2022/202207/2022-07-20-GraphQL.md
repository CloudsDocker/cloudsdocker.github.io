# Summary

# What it means GraphQL
 - It a server-side technology.
 - It gives a `declarative` way of fetching and updating your data. , which is not imperative.
 - It follows `client-driven` architecture. (comparing to `server-driven` in REST)
 - In GraphQL, the server determines available resources.
 - It is strongly and static typed.
 - GraphQL API endpoints are single.
 - It is hierarchical and product-centric.


# When NO GraphQL 
 - Overkill for small applications.
 - It is not a good solution for simple applications as it can add complexity.
 - 


# Relationship with REST

- GraphQL is an application layer server-side technology that is used for executing queries with existing data while REST is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints for creating Web services.
- GraphQL can be organized in terms of a schema whereas REST can be arranged in terms of endpoints.
- The `development speed in GraphQL is fast` while the development speed in REST is Slow.


## Show create scripts 

```
show create table table_name;
```

## To show all records vertically (and more human readable)
To add a postfix `\G` in each query, e.g. 

``` 
select * from table1 limit 1 \G;
```
The output will look like below, easier for developer to check and see.
