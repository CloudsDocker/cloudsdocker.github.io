# yarn install vs npm install

When we run npm install , the dependencies are installed sequentially, one after another. The output logs in the terminal are informative but a bit hard to read. To install the packages with Yarn, we run the yarn command. Yarn installs packages in parallel, which is one of the reasons it's quicker than npm.
