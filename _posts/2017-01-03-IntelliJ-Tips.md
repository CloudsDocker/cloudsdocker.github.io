By defining a Scope when searching, you can include/exclude arbitrary files/folders from that scope.
Detailed Answer
One way to achieve your requirement (excluding files and folders from a search) is to define a custom scope. This is specifically useful because sometimes you just want to exclude a folder from your search and not from the whole project.
Follow these steps:
Edit -> Find -> Find in path or press Ctrl+Shift+F.Choose Custom in the Scope section and then choose <unknown scope>
