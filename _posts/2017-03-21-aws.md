After establishing a SSH session, you can install a default web server by executing sudo yum install httpd -y. To start the web server, type sudo service httpd start and press Return to execute the command. Your web browser should show a placeholder site if you open http://$PublicIp with $PublicIp replaced by the public IP address of your virtual server.
