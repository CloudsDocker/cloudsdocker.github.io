## Design philosophies

### fast-path
```java
/**
         * Get the entry associated with key.  This method
         * itself handles only the fast path: a direct hit of existing
         * key. It otherwise relays to getEntryAfterMiss.  This is
         * designed to maximize performance for direct hits, in part
         * by making this method readily inlinable.
         *
         * @param  key the thread local object
         * @return the entry associated with key, or null if no such
         */
        private Entry getEntry(ThreadLocal key) {
            int i = key.threadLocalHashCode & (table.length - 1);
            Entry e = table[i];
            if (e != null && e.get() == key)
                return e;
            else
                return getEntryAfterMiss(key, i, e);
        }
```
