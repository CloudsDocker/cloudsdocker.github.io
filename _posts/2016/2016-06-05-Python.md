# Python items

Test item,

MapReduce的设计灵感来自于函数式编程，这里不打算提MapReduce，就拿python中的map()函数来学习一下


# Single Qutoe vs Double Quote
There is no difference between using single quotes and double quotes in Python

# Generators presentation:

```python
wwwlog=open('weblog.debug')
bytecolumn=(line.rsplit(None,1)[1] for line in wwwlog)
bytes=(int(x) for x in bytecolumn if x!='-')
print "total:", sum(bytes)
```

## Generator as a pipeline

At each step, we declare an operation that will be applied to the entire input stream, like `rsplit` to all lines of the input log file. Rather than take a huge memory to process a huge file.

The key is 'think big'. Instead of focusing on the problem at a line-by-line level, you just break it down into big operations that operate on the whole file.

### Iteration is the glue


# rsplit
[API doc](http://python-reference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/str/rsplit.html)
Returns a list of the words in the string, separated by the delimiter string (starting from right).
```python
>>> ' a b c '.rsplit(None, 1)
[' a b', 'c']
>>> ' a b c '.rsplit(None, 2)
[' a', 'b', 'c']
```
