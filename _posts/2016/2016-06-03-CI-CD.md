# Concepts

`CI/CD` are usage of Docker, `CI` is continuous integration, is the process of eliciting fast, automated feedback on the *correctness* of your application every time there is a change to the code, while `CD` means continuous delivery, build upon the earlier concept by providing fast, automated feedback on the *correctness* and *production readiness* of your application every time there is a chance to *code, infrastructure, or configuration*.


# Some "best practices"

- Frequent commits to a common code stream
- Disallow commits into a "broken" build
- A "broken" build on CI should be attended to immediately and its resolutin should be of utmost priority
