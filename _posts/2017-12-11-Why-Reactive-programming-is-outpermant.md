The second advantage to a lazy subscription is that the observable doesnâ€™t hold onto data by default. In the previous example, each event generated by the interval will be processed and then dropped. This is what we mean when we say that the observable is streaming in nature rather than pooled. This discard-by-default semantic means that you never have to worry about unbounded memory growth sneaking up on you, causing memory leaks. When writing native event-driven JavaScript code, especially in older browsers, memory leaks can occur if you neglect event management and disposal.
