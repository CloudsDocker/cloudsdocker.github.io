# Notes
- JDK 1.0 introduced **rudimentary I/O facilities** for accessing the file system (to create a directory, remove a file, or perform another task), accessing file content randomly (as opposed to sequentially), and streaming byte-oriented data between sources and destinations in a sequential manner.
