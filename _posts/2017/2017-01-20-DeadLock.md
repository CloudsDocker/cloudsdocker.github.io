# Concept

- Two or more threads are **waiting** for **each other** to **release lock** and get **stuck for infinite time**.
- It will only happen in case of **multitasking**.

## One screnario of dead lock
If method1() and method2() both will be called by two or many threads , there is a good chance of deadlock because if thread 1 acquires lock on Sting object while executing method1() and thread 2 acquires lock on Integer object while executing method2() both will be waiting for each other to release lock on Integer and String to proceed further which will never happen.

### The root cause is NOT multithreading, but **the way they are requiring lock**
Now there would not be any deadlock because both methods are accessing lock on Integer and String class literal in same order. So, if thread A acquires lock on Integer object , thread B will not proceed until thread A releases Integer lock, same way thread A will not be blocked even if thread B holds String lock because now thread B will not expect thread A to release Integer lock to proceed further.
