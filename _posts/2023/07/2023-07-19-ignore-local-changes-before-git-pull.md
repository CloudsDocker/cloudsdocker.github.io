# Resolving Untracked File Conflicts When Updating a Git Branch

When working with Git, you might encounter a situation where your local branch is behind the remote branch and there are untracked files that prevent you from pulling the latest changes. In this blog post, we'll walk through a step-by-step solution to resolve this issue.

## The Problem

You try to update your local `preprod` branch but encounter an error due to untracked files:
```sh
Already on 'preprod'
Your branch is behind 'origin/preprod' by 61 commits, and can be fast-forwarded.
  (use "git pull" to update your local branch)
error: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by merge:
    doc/api/v3/api.yaml
Please move or remove them before you merge.
Aborting
Even after using git checkout -f preprod, the untracked files are not removed.

Understanding the Issue
The git checkout -f branch command forces a checkout of the specified branch, discarding local changes to tracked files. However, it does not remove untracked files. Untracked files are those that are not under version control in Git.

Solutions
Option 1: Stash Untracked Files
Stash the untracked files to save their changes temporarily:

sh
Copy code
git stash push -m "Stash before pull" --include-untracked
Option 2: Remove Untracked Files
If you don't need the untracked files, you can remove them:

sh
Copy code
rm path/to/untracked/file
# or to remove all untracked files and directories:
git clean -fd
Option 3: Move Untracked Files
Move the untracked files to a different location temporarily:

sh
Copy code
mv path/to/untracked/file /path/to/backup/location
Step-by-Step Guide
Check the status to confirm untracked files:

sh
Copy code
git status
Choose one of the options to handle untracked files:

Stash untracked files:
sh
Copy code
git stash push -m "Stash before pull" --include-untracked
Remove untracked files:
sh
Copy code
rm path/to/untracked/file
# or to remove all untracked files and directories:
git clean -fd
Move untracked files:
sh
Copy code
mv path/to/untracked/file /path/to/backup/location
Force checkout to the desired branch (if not already done):

sh
Copy code
git checkout -f preprod
Pull the latest changes from the remote branch:

sh
Copy code
git pull origin preprod
Reapply stashed changes (if applicable):

sh
Copy code
git stash pop
By following these steps, you can update your local branch without encountering issues with untracked files. Happy coding!

Conclusion
Handling untracked files in Git requires additional steps beyond force-checking out a branch. By stashing, removing, or moving these files, you can ensure a smooth update of your local branch. If you encounter any further issues or need additional help, feel free to reach out!
