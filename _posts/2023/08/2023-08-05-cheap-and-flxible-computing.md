# Cheaper X 2 to EC2, to use Fargate Spot
With Fargate Spot you can run interruption tolerant Amazon ECS tasks at a discounted rate compared to
the AWS Fargate price. Fargate Spot runs tasks on spare compute capacity. When AWS needs the capacity
back, your tasks will be interrupted with a two-minute warning.
