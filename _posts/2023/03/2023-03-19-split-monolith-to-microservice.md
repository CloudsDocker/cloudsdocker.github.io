Splitting a monolithic application into microservices can be a complex process that requires careful planning and implementation. Here is a high-level approach to splitting a monolithic application into Spring Boot microservices:

Identify the bounded contexts: Begin by identifying the different business capabilities or domains within the application. Each of these domains should be self-contained and independent of each other. These boundaries are known as bounded contexts and can be used to define the microservices.
Define the service interfaces: Once the bounded contexts have been identified, define the interfaces for each service. These interfaces should be designed to be lightweight and platform-agnostic to ensure interoperability with other services.
Decouple the services: Decouple the services by using asynchronous messaging or RESTful APIs to communicate between them. This will ensure that each service can scale independently without impacting the others.
Refactor the code: Refactor the monolithic codebase to create separate modules for each service. This may involve breaking apart existing functionality and creating new modules to support the microservices architecture.
Containerize the microservices: Containerize each microservice using Docker or another containerization tool. This will make it easier to manage the deployment and scaling of each service.
Deploy the microservices: Deploy the microservices to a cloud-based platform like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. This will enable you to take advantage of the platform's built-in scalability and reliability features.
Monitor and manage the microservices: Finally, implement monitoring and management tools to ensure that each microservice is performing optimally. This will help you identify and resolve issues quickly, ensuring that your microservices architecture remains stable and scalable.
By following these steps, you can successfully split a monolithic application into Spring Boot microservices. It's important to note that this process can be time-consuming and may require significant refactoring of the existing codebase. However, the benefits of a microservices architecture, including increased scalability, flexibility, and resilience, make the effort worthwhile.
