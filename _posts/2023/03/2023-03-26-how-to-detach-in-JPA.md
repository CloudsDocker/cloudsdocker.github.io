# A real sample of using JPA detach

Here's an example of using EntityManager.detach() to detach an entity from the persistence context in JPA:


```java
@Service
public class MyService {
  
  @PersistenceContext
  private EntityManager entityManager;
  
  public void updateItem(Item item) {
    // Load the item from the database
    Item managedItem = entityManager.find(Item.class, item.getId());
    
    // Update the managed item with the new values
    managedItem.setName(item.getName());
    managedItem.setPrice(item.getPrice());
    
    // Detach the managed item from the persistence context
    entityManager.detach(managedItem);
    
    // Update the detached item with the new values
    item.setPrice(item.getPrice() * 1.1);
    
    // Save the updated item back to the database
    entityManager.merge(item);
  }
  
}
```

In this example, we have a service method updateItem() that updates an Item entity. First, we load the Item from the database using entityManager.find(), which returns a managed entity that is attached to the persistence context.

Next, we update the managed entity with the new values using setters. We then use entityManager.detach() to detach the managed entity from the persistence context, which means that any changes made to the entity will not be automatically persisted to the database.

We then update the detached entity with the new values, in this case increasing the price by 10%. Finally, we save the updated entity back to the database using entityManager.merge(), which merges the detached entity back into the persistence context and persists the changes to the database.

Detaching an entity can be useful when you need to perform complex updates or calculations on an entity that should not be persisted immediately to the database. By detaching the entity, you can make changes to it without affecting the database until you are ready to save the changes back to the database.


# Why to use detach of JPA

In JPA, detaching an entity means removing the entity from the persistence context, which means that any changes made to the entity will not be automatically persisted to the database. There are several reasons why you might want to use EntityManager.detach() to detach an entity from the persistence context:

 - Performance: Detaching an entity can improve performance by reducing the amount of data that is managed by the persistence context. If you have a large number of entities that are not needed for the remainder of a transaction, detaching them can free up memory and improve performance.
 - Avoiding Optimistic Locking Issues: If you are using optimistic locking in JPA, detaching an entity can help avoid optimistic locking issues. If you have two transactions updating the same entity simultaneously, one transaction may throw an optimistic locking exception if the entity has been modified in the persistence context. By detaching the entity before updating it, you can avoid these issues.
 - Complex Updates: If you need to perform complex updates or calculations on an entity that should not be persisted immediately to the database, detaching the entity can be useful. This allows you to make changes to the entity without affecting the database until you are ready to save the changes back to the database.
 - Caching: Detaching an entity can be useful for caching purposes. If you need to cache an entity for a long period of time, detaching it can prevent changes to the entity from being persisted to the database until you are ready to save the changes back to the database.

Overall, detaching an entity can be a useful tool in JPA for improving performance, avoiding optimistic locking issues, performing complex updates, and caching. However, it's important to use it judiciously and only when necessary, as detaching entities can have implications for the consistency of your data.



# Here are a few more reasons why you might want to use EntityManager.detach() in JPA:

 - Managing Transactions: Detaching an entity can help manage transactions in JPA. If you have a long-running transaction that needs to access a large number of entities, you can use EntityManager.detach() to detach the entities that are no longer needed, which can free up memory and improve performance. This can also help manage transaction size, which can be important in certain applications.
 - Persistence Context Management: Detaching an entity can be useful for managing the persistence context in JPA. If you have a large number of entities that are being managed by the persistence context, you can use EntityManager.detach() to detach some of the entities and reduce the size of the persistence context. This can improve performance and reduce memory usage.
 - Query Results: Detaching an entity can be useful when working with query results in JPA. If you are using a query that returns a large number of entities, you can use EntityManager.detach() to detach some of the entities that are not needed. This can improve performance and reduce memory usage.
 - Cache Management: Detaching an entity can be useful for managing the cache in JPA. If you are using a second-level cache, you can use EntityManager.detach() to remove an entity from the cache. This can be useful if the entity has been modified in the database and you need to refresh it from the database.

 Overall, EntityManager.detach() can be a useful tool for managing the persistence context, managing transactions, improving performance, and managing the cache in JPA. However, it's important to use it judiciously and only when necessary, as detaching entities can have implications for the consistency of your data.
