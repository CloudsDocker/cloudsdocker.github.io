# what's usage of bootstrap yml
In a Spring Boot application, the bootstrap.yml (or bootstrap.properties) file is used for configuring the application's environment and setting up the context in which the application will run.

Specifically, the bootstrap.yml file is loaded very early in the application startup process, even before the application's application.yml (or application.properties) file is loaded. This allows you to configure properties that are required for setting up the application context, such as configuring the Spring Cloud Config server or setting up the encryption/decryption keys for encrypted properties.

Here are some examples of how you might use the bootstrap.yml file in a Spring Boot application:

Setting up the Spring Cloud Config server:
yaml
Copy code
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      uri: http://localhost:8888
      username: myuser
      password: mypassword
Setting up the encryption/decryption keys for encrypted properties:
yaml
Copy code
encrypt:
  key-store:
    location: classpath:/keystore.jks
    password: mypassword
    alias: myalias
    secret: mysecret
Configuring the application to use a different profile for the Spring Cloud Config server:
yaml
Copy code
spring:
  profiles:
    active: dev
  cloud:
    config:
      profile: dev
Note that the bootstrap.yml file is not always necessary for all Spring Boot applications. It is typically used for applications that require more complex configuration setup or for applications that use Spring Cloud Config or other similar external configuration servers. For simpler applications, you may be able to get away with just using the application.yml file.


# Here are some best practices for using bootstrap.yml in a microservice environment:

Use bootstrap.yml for configuration that is required for setting up the application context. This could include configuration for things like service discovery, security, or external configuration servers.
Keep the bootstrap.yml file small and focused on setting up the application context. Avoid putting configuration that is specific to a particular microservice in the bootstrap.yml file, as this can make it harder to manage and maintain.
Use different bootstrap.yml files for different environments (e.g. development, testing, production). This can allow you to configure things like the Spring Cloud Config server or service discovery endpoints differently for each environment.
Use a configuration server like Spring Cloud Config to manage configuration for your microservices. This can help to centralize configuration management and ensure that all microservices have access to the same configuration properties.
Use encryption to secure sensitive configuration properties. Spring Cloud Config supports encryption and decryption of configuration properties, so you can store sensitive properties in the configuration server without exposing them to unauthorized access.
Be careful when using the spring.cloud.bootstrap.enabled property to disable bootstrap.yml processing. While this can be useful in some cases, it can also cause problems if the application relies on configuration that is normally set up in the bootstrap.yml file. If you need to disable bootstrap.yml processing, consider using a separate property file instead.
