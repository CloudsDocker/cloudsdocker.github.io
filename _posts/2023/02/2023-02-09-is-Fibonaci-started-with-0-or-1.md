The Fibonacci sequence can start with either 0 or 1, depending on the convention used.

If we start the sequence with 0, the first few terms are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ...

On the other hand, if we start the sequence with 1, the first few terms are: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

The choice of the starting value is a matter of convention, and both versions of the sequence are used in mathematics and other fields. However, it's worth noting that the sequence that starts with 0 is more common in computer science and programming, since it can simplify certain algorithms and indexing operations.
