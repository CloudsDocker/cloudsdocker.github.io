# How-to-auto-test-via-headless-browser-in-python
To run headless tests in Python, you can use a headless browser or a browser automation tool such as Selenium WebDriver. Here's an example of how to use Selenium WebDriver in Python to run headless tests:

1. Install Selenium WebDriver and a driver for your desired browser. For example, if you want to use Chrome, you can install the chromedriver binary and the selenium package using pip:
```shell
pip install selenium
```

2. Import the necessary packages in your Python script:

```python

from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options
```
Set up the headless browser options by creating a new instance of the Options class and setting the headless property to True:

```python
options = Options()
options.headless = True

```

3. Create a new instance of the webdriver class and pass in the options:
```python
browser = webdriver.Chrome(options=options)
```
4. Use the browser object to interact with the website or application you are testing, just as you would in a regular browser:
```python
browser.get('https://www.google.com')
assert 'Google' in browser.title
```
5. Close the browser when you are finished:
```python
browser.quit()
```
6. By setting the headless option to True, the browser will run in the background and not display any graphical user interface. This makes it useful for running tests in environments where a GUI is not available, such as on a server or in a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline.
