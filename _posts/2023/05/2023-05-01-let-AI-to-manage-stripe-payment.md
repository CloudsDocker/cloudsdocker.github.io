## How to add new events to an existing Stripe webhook endpoint with some AI scripts

First of , full code can be found at https://github.com/CloudsDocker/AI_manage_stripe_payment

Stripe is a popular payment processing platform used by businesses of all sizes. Stripe offers a feature called webhooks, which allows you to receive real-time notifications about events that occur in your Stripe account. Webhooks can be used to automate tasks, synchronize data between systems, and more.

In this blog, we will discuss how to add events to a Stripe webhook endpoint using the Stripe API.

# Prerequisites
Before we start, you'll need the following:
 
 - A Stripe account
 - A webhook endpoint URL that can receive webhook notifications
 - A Stripe API key with write access


## Adding events to a webhook endpoint using the Stripe API
 - To add events to a webhook endpoint using the Stripe API, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the stripe module:

```
import stripe
```

2. Set your Stripe API key:


```
stripe.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Make sure to replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual Stripe API key.

3. Retrieve the existing webhook endpoint:

```
webhook_endpoint_id = "WEBHOOK_ENDPOINT_ID"
webhook_endpoint = stripe.WebhookEndpoint.retrieve(webhook_endpoint_id)
```

Make sure to replace "WEBHOOK_ENDPOINT_ID" with the ID of the existing webhook endpoint you want to modify.

4. Add the events to the listener list for the webhook endpoint:

```
webhook_endpoint.enabled_events += ["setup_intent.created", "setup_intent.succeeded", "setup_intent.setup_failed", "setup_intent.requires_action"]
```
5.Save the changes to the webhook endpoint:
webhook_endpoint.save()

6. Print a confirmation message:

```
print("Webhook endpoint updated successfully.")
```
And that's it! You have successfully added events to a Stripe webhook endpoint using the Stripe API.

# Conclusion
In this blog, we have discussed how to add events to a Stripe webhook endpoint using the Stripe API. By following these steps, you can ensure that your webhook endpoint receives notifications for the events you are interested in. This can help you automate tasks, synchronize data between systems, and more.

As always, it's important to test your webhook endpoint thoroughly before deploying it to a production environment. Stripe provides a webhook testing tool that you can use to simulate webhook notifications and verify that your endpoint is receiving them correctly.

Thank you for reading, and happy coding!
